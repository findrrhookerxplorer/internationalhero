<B>History: </B>The origins of the Atomic Bacterial Chemical Warriors lie
in the Starlord series Ro-Busters. This story of a robotic disaster relief
squad (think Thunderbirds with less wooden actors) included former war droid
Hammerstein as one of the leads. (Ro-Jaws was the other one). Ro-Busters
was one of the strips that survived Starlord's merger with 2000 A.D., and
it was in their new home that the foundation was laid for the ABC Warriors,
when Hammerstein told his fellow robots of his war years. After Ro-Busters
reached it's conclusion, a prequel of sorts would return to this earlier
part of the war droid's life. Written by Pat Mills and with art by Kevin
O'Neill, it debuted in Prof #119. We joined Hammerstein and his co-horts
Joe Pineapples and Happy Shrapnel in the latter days of the Volg War (see
<A HREF="../b/bsavage.htm">Bill Savage</A>), where they were recruited to
gather a very special squad for a dangerous mission. The war ended before
the squad was fully gathered, but that didn't matter - because the squad's
mission didn't have anything to do with the war. Instead, they were to tame
the newly colonised Mars. For many progs the Warriors faced the worst the
Red Planet had to throw at them, bringing justice to the frontier world.
They told those they encountered to make sure others knew that the warriors
were coming:&nbsp;Spread the Word!

going their separate ways. It was centuries later, when Earth had been taken
over by the totalitarian regime of the alien hating Torquemada, that Nemesis
the Warlock recruited Hammerstein and had him reform the squad. Under his
command they would be sent to battle throughout time and space.
