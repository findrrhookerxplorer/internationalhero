<B>History</B>: Kidnapped by an underground race of aliens as a baby, Andor
was raised under alien technology to be turned into a weapon meant to destroy
the human race. One thing changed his mind: a T.H.U.N.D.E.R. agent named
Kitty Kane. Originally hating the human race, Andor's point of view was changed
when he first layed eyes on the beautiful female.

of where his loyalties were due, Andor attacked his former masters, and became
an outcast of both races. The current whereabouts of Andor are unknown.

<B>Comments</B>: Thanks to Mac Murdock for informing me of this character's
existence, and for providing information and images of him. Both he and Josh
Geren have noted that he is unique because he was the first character to
have a healing factor that was noted in the context of the story.
