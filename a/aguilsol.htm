<IMG SRC="aguilasol1.jpg" WIDTH="323" HEIGHT="400" ALIGN="Left"><B>History</B>:
Aguila Solitaria was a Native American child whose unidentified tribe was
massacred on the orders of the gunfighter Morgan, who was hunting for a treasure
and personally killed Aguila&#180;s father when he refused to speak about
the treasure. The sole survivor, Aguila Solitaria hid in the mountains, where,
hungry and weak, he was captured by &#147;Thegame,&#148; an eagle. Thegame
adopted him and taught him the arts and ways of the eagles, until eventually,
using the feathers of dead eagles, Aguila Solitaria created wings and learned
to fly. Once&nbsp;he grew up, he left the mountains&nbsp;to avenge and protect
his people from the white man, and other magical and mystic enemies. He pursued
Morgan, and after several near misses, avenged his father, slaying the cowardly
gunman with an arrow in his back as he tried to flee. He befriended Buffalo
Bill, but as duty forced Bill to pursue Aguila Solitaria, he also proved
to the be the winged fighter's greatest enemy.

Another opponent was the bounty hunter, the Arizona Kid, a cruel Apache hater,
who Aguila exposed as an Apache renegade, before handing him over to same
for judgement. He was blamed for the crimes of another winged Native American,
Kurdo, who had been raised by falcons, and who exploited their similar
appearances to frame Aguila for some of his crimes; Kurdo also nearly killed
Buffalo Bill, who survived thanks to Aguila's aid. Eventually Aguila slew
Kurdo, and cut out his heart. Rosco was a gypsy who used black magic against
Aguila, but whose daughter Lorena fell in love with Aguila and ran away with
him. L&aacute;tigo was Morgan's daughter, who adopted the identity of la
Sombra (the Shadow) to seek revenge for her father's demise, only to fall
in love with Aguila and abandon her pursuit of vengeance; years later she
returned to kidnap Aguila's son Kei. Eventually Aguila Solitaria joined a
Native American confederation alongside Apaches, Seris, Navajos, Cherokees,
Shius, to battle the white man, though he was aware any victory they won
was likely to only be temporary.

Thanks to Javier Delgado for most of the above information and additional
images. He notes that <I>"While Aguila Solitaria started as an &#147;Anti-
western&#148; (75% of Mexican population is of native american origin), the
adventures became more fantastic, resembling the adventures of his editorial
brothers, like Arandu, Kaliman, and Orion. It ran for 759 numbers. Like most
Mexican comics of the time, Aguila Solitaria was printed in Sepia in the
interiors. Also was published in Colombia by &#147;Editora cinco.&#148;"</I>
