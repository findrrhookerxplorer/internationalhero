<B>History</B>: Danika Nolan was the adopted daughter of Robert Nolan, a
CIA agent. Danika herself grew up an "army brat", travelling from one place
to the next as her father's job moved him around the world. When she was
fourteen she witnessed her father being attacked by men dressed as ninjas,
and her powers manifested, allowing her to save him.

As an adult, Danika became a Las Vegas showgirl, working out of a casino.
When she was attacked by four men intent on raping her, her powers surfaced
again, though in truth it was her martial arts skill that drove them off.
Some time later, the monsterous Leon DeVry attempted to steal her powers,
and once more her abilities came to the fore. This time she was saved by
the vampire NSA agent Bloodlust.
