<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Superhuman strength, amazing control of his body,

<B>History</B>: "In 1920, an orphaned infant was brought to a secret fortress
hidden high in the mountains of Tibet. This was the home base of a mysterious
group of mystics who were known as the Council of Seven. While raising the
child, the mystics used their arcane knowledge to endow the boy with powers
beyond the ordinary. When he reached adulthood, they bequeathed to him a
great fortune and sent him to America. Upon arriving in this country in the
late 1930's, John Aman set himself up in New York City. Such was the fortune
endowed upon him by his mentors that he never needed to hold a job -- other
than the one he was destined to have, that of Amazing Man." - Protectors

<B>Comments</B>: Based on the Golden Age <A HREF="amazman1.htm">Amazing Man</A>
(and one case where the original version and his Malibu version weren't greatly
different). A similar backstory was later used to provide Iron Fist with
his origin in the 1970's. Thanks to Mike Murphy for providing the information
in this and the above paragraph.

Through his adventures, he became friends with Zona Hendersen and made her
kid brother his sidekick, Tommy the Amazing Boy.
