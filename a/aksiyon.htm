Gabriel is the son of a scientist who gave his boy a formula which made him
super strong and nearly-invulnerable. He also fashioned a heat-resistant
costume for Gabriel, complete with a cape that enabled him to fly. Thus Kapitan
Aksiyon was born. At first the scientist wanted fame and fortune, but upon
seeing the good that his son could do with his powers, he decided to keep
his formula a secret. Knowing it worked was enough for him.

The comics character first appeared in the television screen on an episode
of "Komiks" (Komiks, 2006), a television show featuring Filipino comics stories.
Alfred Vargas was the first actor to play the role.
