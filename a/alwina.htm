<B>History</B>: The Mulawin are a race of magical beings, part man and part
bird, who serve to defend humanity from the Ravenas, a subversive sub-set
of their own species. Years ago Bagwis, one of the senior Mulawin, fathered
a child with his human lover, Veronica; he hid his daughter Alwina to grow
up among the humans because the Ravenas wanted to kill her, secretly defended
by Aguiluz, a young but capable Mulawin. Now that Alwina is fully grown,
Aguiluz has fallen in love with her, and Alwina, as the one destined to save
humanity together with Aguiluz, constantly battle the Ravenas, as they seek
to destroy both Alwina and the entire human race.

marked a milestone in the history of Philippine television. This soap opera
boosted Angel Locsin's career. She is currently the lead star in Mars Ravelo's
