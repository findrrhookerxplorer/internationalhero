<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Adapt could absorb inorganic matter, or even walk
throuh it as if it was air. Bullets could not harm him, and in a fight he
would absorb whatever detritus was in the area to form both armour and a
weapon around his body. He could use anything he absorbed to carry out it's
original function, only now as part of his body (be they computers or machine
guns). He was still vulnerable to organic matter however, and so was unable
to prevent The Fisher snapping his neck with his bare hands.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Adapt was a member of the superteam known as the Watch. After
the team had discovered evidence of experiments being carried out on superhumans,
Adapt decided to go public with the information. The
<A HREF="../f/fisher.htm">Fisher</A>, believing that this would be disastrous
for all superhumans, asled Adapt not to do so. When Adapt ignored him, Fisher
snapped his neck, killing him. His corpse was retrieved by Dr.Walsley, apparently
to be used in the next generation of Typhon.
