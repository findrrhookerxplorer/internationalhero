<B>History</B>: The Mulawin are a race of magical beings, part man and part
bird, who serve to defend humanity from the Ravenas, a subversive sub-set
of their own species. Years ago Bagwis, one of the senior Mulawin, fathered
a child with his human lover, Veronica; he hid his daughter Alwina to grow
up among the humans, secretly defended by Aguiluz, a young but capable Mulawin.
Now that Alwina is fully grown, Aguiluz has fallen in love with her, and
is forced to constantly battle the Ravenas, as they seek to destroy both
Alwina and the entire human race.
