<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: A-Ko is incredibly strong, to a frightening degree.
She wears special armbands which help keep her strength to controllable levels,
but even with these she can knock down buildings with items she casually
flicks away. She can leap over buildings without breaking stride, and is
superhumanly fast, able to exceed the speed of sound. Since she has a habit
of oversleeping, she runs to school each morning, and each step which strikes
the road shatters the concrete and causes miniature earthquakes. She is
presumably superhumanly tough too, or else she would soon cause herself serious
injury with her own powers.

<B>History</B>: Eiko Magami, known to her friends as A-Ko, was a seventeen
year old school girl who somehow possessed superhuman strength and speed,
perhaps inherited from her parents, who bore an uncanny resemblance to two
famous American superheroes. A-Ko was so used to these abilities that she
often seemed to forget she had them, which tended to mean she left a wake
of destruction behind her... especially during her regular run to school
each morning after she overslept. She was also quite short tempered, not
a good thing given her powers. A-Ko lived in Graviton City, a place used
to strange events, having a large lake and island in the middle of it which
was created when an alien spaceship crash landed many years earlier. Her
best friend was a cute but extremely thick and immature girl known as C-Ko,
unknowingly a lost alien princess who came to Earth in the aforementioned
spaceship. A-Ko was extremely loyal to her friend, which proved to be handy
when aliens from another ship show up looking for their lost royalty. Another
problem for A-Ko was that she had a rival for the friendship of C-Ko. Spoiled
rich kid B-Ko, used to always getting her own way,&nbsp;had decided that
her prestige at school would increase if C-Ko was her friend. Feeling that
A-Ko was an obstacle in her path, B-Ko would regularly pick fights with her
superpowered rival, using high technology and powered armour to even the
odds.
