<B>History</B>: Civilisation as we know it collapsed just over a decade in
the future (the year 1996), with widescale nuclear conflict, plagues, rioting,
and the spread of religious fundamentalism. In the wake of these disasters
corporate heads and the U.S. government fled to the relative safety of Mars,
where they watched things develop. By 2031 things had stabilised somewhat,
though life on Earth remained chaotic and dangerous, and the rulers (now
known as The Plex) remained on the red planet. What law there was on the
homeworld was enforced by paramilitary groups such as the Plexus Rangers.

Born and raised on Mars, Reuben Flagg had made his living as an actor, playing
the part of Mark Thrust, Sexus Ranger, a star on Earth, Mars and Luna. Advances
in holographic technology allowed his employers to ditch their hedonistic
and troublesome leading man, replacing him with a computer-generated replica.
Now out of work, Flagg was forced to join the Plexus Rangers and stationed
on Earth, becoming one of the protectors of the Chicago Plexmall. Partnered
with Raul, a talking cat, and Luther Ironheart, a robot, he did his best
to protect the American way of life...what was left of it. Flagg used his
former star status to sleep with many women, but his main girlfriends were
Gretchen Holstrum, the hostess of the Plexmall's Love Canal, and Amanda Krieger,
the daughter of the chief of police.
