<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Ambrose was capable of generating a "selective physics
distortion field" meaning he was able to temporarily relax or suspend the
laws of physics around his body. Ambrose usually used his powers to speed
up his subjective time, effectively giving him super speed, or suspend gravity
around his body, allowing him to run on vertical surfaces (presumably among
other things). It's commonly thought that Ambrose was actually the deadliest
of the field team, even overshadowing <A HREF="../j/jakita.htm">Jakita
Wagner</A> and <A HREF="../s/snow.htm">Elijah Snow</A> in terms of sheer
power. Ambrose was also an exceptionally excellent marksman with pistols.

<B>History</B>: Ambrose Chase was the son of one of the surviving test subjects
of U.S. Science City Zero (said to be America's covert answer to Russian
science cities during the early cold war era, but actually a research station
testing the limits of the human body) and another unknown person. Though
much of Ambrose's history is hazy we do know that Elijah Snow made and kept
contact with Ambrose from a very early age, becoming a close friend of his
family and slowly guiding him towards a career in Planetary. After Elijah
Snow disappeared Ambrose became the defacto leader of the field team, but
unfortunately while raiding an installation used by the Four to create a
tangible yet fictional universe Ambrose was gunned down (the installation
apparently followed the rules of the fictional universe, which seemed to
be straight out of a bad Sci-Fi movie - including the cliched "The black
man always dies first."). What actually happened to Ambrose after his death
is a mystery even to those who witnessed it; he seems to have been swallowed
by his own physics distortion field.
