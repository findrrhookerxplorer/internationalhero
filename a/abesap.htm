<B>History</B>: Abe Sapien is a mer-man of uncertain origins. He was found
by plumbers in a state of suspended animation in a water-filled casket hidden
away in a forgotten chamber in the basement of St.Trinians' Hospital in
Washington, D.C. When awoken he was recruited to work for the BRPD, the agency
called in when he was discovered, acting as an operative investigating paranormal
events and incidents. His name came from his container: on it was a label
with the date that Abraham Lincoln was killed on it (hence Abe), while the
container itself was inscribed with a note that he was a "Ichthyo Sapien".
