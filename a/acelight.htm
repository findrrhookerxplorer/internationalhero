<B>History</B>: Mark Hollander had recently moved to America from his native
England. One night, as a storm raged around his house, he played his favourite
video game, "Ace Lightning and the Carnival of Doom". Mark had just discovered
a hidden level (#7), and was about to enter it, when lightning struck the
satellite dish. The power raced through the cables, down into Mark's computer,
somehow bringing the characters within the program to life.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Now Ace Lightning and his enemies are real, and continuing their battles
to gather the pieces of the Amulet of Zoar, starting with a fight in Mark's
back yard - to them the real world is simply another level of the video game.
Afterwards, when the villains had fled into the night to regroup, Ace enlisted
Mark's assistance, figuring he had to be a fellow "Lightning Knight". Now
Mark has to struggle to be a superhero, while also trying to live a normal
life.
