<B>History</B>: Don Caldwell was an American student studying in Buenos Aires.
He had lived there for several years, becoming virtually a native, even to
the extent of learning the skills of local gauchos (riding, roping bulls,
etc), and learning of the area's legendary hero and liberator,
<A HREF="../e/elgaucho.htm">el Gaucho</A>. Shortly after Don graduated, his
friend Carlos expressed the concern that there were troubled time ahead for
Argentina, and stated his sadness that Don would soon be returning to the
U.S. Later that night Don went to visit the town's memorial statue to El
Gaucho, where he encountered an elderly man, the grandson of one of El Gaucho's
allies. Fearing the future waiting for his country, the old man had picked
Don as a possible successor to resurrect the identity of the masked freedom
fighter, and gave the student the hero's costume.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
A few months later the statue of El Gaucho disappeared, causing the city
to become rife with rumours that El Gaucho was alive again. Sure enough,
a masked man dressed as the hero was soon causing trouble for local Nazi
agents, led by the villainous Baron Girbel. After El Gaucho broke the local
spy ring, Girbel fled to America, and Don gave chase. He thwarted an attempt
by the Baron to hijack a freighter carrying a defense cargo, then continued
to battle crime and enemy agents in his native land, now known as the American
Avenger.

<B>Comments</B>: Created by Vince Alascia (most probably). His sole
acknowledgement in the "modern era" was when he was listed among a number
of other wartime patriotic heroes in USAgent #3.
