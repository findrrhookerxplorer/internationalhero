<B>History</B>: Allan A Dale was a minstrel whose songs and music were regularly
heard throughout the leafy splendour of the Greenwood. Robin first encountered
a broken-hearted Alan. Alan's girlfriend (called Ellen most often, but it
is variable) was forced to marry a cruel, old knight. Disguised as a harper,
Robin interrupted the wedding and rescued Ellen. Alan and Ellen were married
by Friar Tuck.
