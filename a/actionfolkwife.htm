<B>History</B>: Helen comes from a long line of heroes. In the course of
their adventures her parents and grand parents where exposed to a lot of
strange energies. As a result the children in her generation where all born
with special powers. Helen had no desire to lead a life of adventure and
so kept her head down, earned her degree, got married and settled into a
peaceful life. Unfortunately she married Enrique Acosta who was at one time
a super hero sidekick. When his identity was exposed via the Internet he
faced semi regular attacks from super villains. It was during a confrontation
with StrongArm that Helen first showed her husband her super powers. She
remains a staunch ally and defender of her husband.
