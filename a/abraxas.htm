<B>History</B>: "His name is Daniel Richmond. His sanity hangs by a thread
which may snap at any moment...for he has beheld scenes beyond human
comprehension. His mind holds only thoughts of revenge. He was born of Earth,
but given the power of the stars. He is of good and evil, for he is: Abraxas!"
<P ALIGN=Justify>
While being attacked by a drunken gang, Daniel Richmond was tranported away
by extra-terrestrials for examination, leaving behind his defenceless wife.
The aliens found in Daniel's mind a grim determination to return home and
exact revenge on those who had attacked him, and so imbued him with cosmic
powers to facilitate this.
