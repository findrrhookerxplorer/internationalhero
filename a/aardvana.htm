In 1977 the concept of creator-owned comics was in it's infancy. If you had
an idea for a comic and wanted it published, then you went to one of the
existing companies (like <A HREF="../m/marvelco.htm">Marvel</A>,
<A HREF="../d/dc.htm">D.C.</A> or <A HREF="archiecom.htm">Archie</A>) and
gave up ownership of your characters to them. About the only companies (that
I am aware of) at that time who even entertained the notion of creators retaining
the ownership of characters were <A HREF="../p/pacific.htm">Pacific</A> and
<A HREF="../c/charlton.htm">Charlton</A> (in the case of some of Steve Ditko's
creations and <A HREF="../e/eman.htm">E-Man</A>).

Dave Sim was (and is) a Canadian writer and artist. A year earlier he had
drawn his girlfriend a mascot character for a fanzine which never got published,
naming the character Cerebus after the dog which guarded Hades, the Greek
underworld (they soon realised they had mis-spelt Cerebrus, btw, but kept
the spelling they had come up with). Deciding to use the character to allow
him to emulate and pay homage to Barry Windsor-Smith's artwork on Conan,
Sim looked at the options and took the risky step of self-publishing. His
girlfriend's two siblings suggested possible names for the company he was
setting up - Aardvark and Vanaheim; Sim opted to use them both.

Aardvark-Vanaheim has never been a big company - discounting Cerebus and
his various reprint titles and anthologies, they've only published a half
dozen titles (Journey, Neil the Horse, Normalman, Flaming Carrot [#1-5, after
which he moved to <A HREF="../r/renegadp.htm">Renegade Press</A>, The Puma
Blues and Strange Brew). However in an industry where publishers come and
go in the blink of an eye, they are still in business, which has to say something
both for the enduring popularity of their flagship character, and the business
acumen of Dave Sim.
