    ALIGN="Left"><B>History</B>: Abbadon was one of the scientists who first
experimented with creating superhumans. He learned that the sudden appearance
of superhumans on Earth was down to an alien species who view mankind as
food, and superhumans as "ripe". Giving himself over to these beings, he
allowed himself to be transformed into their instrument, charged with furthering
this plan to prepare man as a source of sustenance for these beings. &nbsp;Now
he is one of the most powerful superhumans himself, and master of Black Day,
a criminal organisation.
