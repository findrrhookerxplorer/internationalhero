<B>History</B>: Admiral Nemesis is a high-tech pirate and buccaneer. His
reputation is such that <A HREF="aquaveng.htm">Aquavenger</A> instantly knows
who he is the second he spots his infamous ship, the Black Ray. But despite
the Admiral's fearsome reputation, his first encounter with the heroic Aquavenger
ends with his capture.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
(<I>Aquavenger</I>, Pow Annual 1972.) Bob Shane is sailing his fishing vessel
off the New England seaboard&nbsp;when it is boarded by frogmen who warn
him and his shipmate Shellback to leave the area. Once they are gone, Bob
transforms into Aquavenger and follows them back to their base, which turns
out to be the submarine Black Ray, "the Dark Ship of Admiral Nemesis himself".
Spotted by more frogmen, Aquavenger is captured and taken aboard the sinister
vessel, where Nemesis has him thrown into a tank containing a giant squid.
By calling out his name a second time, Aquavenger renews his power and breaks
free of the monster. He then threatens to flood the submarine and release
Nemesis trained sharks amongst the crew. Nemesis and his men surrender.

He might have called himself "Admiral", but he clearly had no idea of ranks
in the Navy, as his uniform has Commodore stripes - and so does that of his
second in command.
