<IMG SRC="ambrosius.jpg" WIDTH="371" HEIGHT="375" ALIGN="Right"><B>Real
Name</B>: Professor Ambrosius
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Identity/Class</B>: &#147;Normal&#148; human being, stretching the definition
of &#147;normal&#148; quite a lot.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Occupation</B>: Griezoloog (Horrorlogist, a well advanced student of the
nasty aspects of the paranormal.)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Affiliations</B>: Head of Griezologisch Genootschap (Horrorlogical Society);
Hong Tong (sidekick/servant).
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Enemies</B>: Enemies? If your work, passion and hobby is the entering
of the tombs of vampires, lairs of unmentionable horrors and the hiding places
of monsters, the interviewing of murdering spirits and you consider the arrival
of a supernatural black ship as a tourist attraction, you don&#146;t get
enemies who want to be close to you, unless it are those awful people pretending
to be an interesting horrible monster for something as mundane as simply
counterfeiting, deceiving a poor horrorlogist looking for a real horror to
investigate. The entities you investigate may however prove to be extremely
dangerous and uncooperative&#133;
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Known Relatives</B>: None (as far as I know, but as the series has been
restarted after a quarter of a century in the same style I&#146;m not sure
about that)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Aliases</B>: None known
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Base of Operations</B>: His house, probably somewhere in the Netherlands
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>First Appearance</B>: Pep1 (1970)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: No powers, his handicap is that he is TOTALLY unafraid
of the most horrible things, which leaves him a much clearer head than most
when confronted with, for instance a hungry werewolf. Clear? In those
circumstances he is exalted until the poor creature has turned out to be
a fake or has fled from this brave researcher. Ambrosius is clearly seen
as a superhero, not because he has any paranormal powers as such, be it that
he has very solid knowledge about them, but because he shows in his profession
almost impossible courage... or is it courage? He is the character most willing
to meet death by the jaws of a werewolf, the hands of a zombie or the tentacles
of an Elder God, while making notations... He is simply superbrave, well
educated and cool headed.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
His knowledge of the more horrible aspects of the supernatural, really body
and soul ripping horror, is immense, probably among the most complete in
the world, so that it can well be seen as a power.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: &#147;According to old established custom the Horrorlogical
Society gathers on Friday the Thirteenth to involve themselves with dark
experiments and horrible things&#133;&#148;, are the words launching this
series about the most dedicated Society of true students of the horrible
aspects of the paranormal ever seen in comics and their leader, Professor
Ambrosius. The first adventure, involving the purchase of a truly haunted
house by the society, leads to Ambrosius experimenting with the summoning
of spirits, which does not go too well, a ruin is blown up and Ambrosius
fails to find a ghost, therefore he goes to the Near East to buy spirits.
In his search for the spirits he meets Hong Tong and hires him for financial
reasons.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Comments</B>: Ambrosius is the President (or Chairman) of the Griezologisch
Genootschap, a Society which seems to have just 13 members at the start of
the series, including the late Dr. Frankenstein. Other known members are
Herr Spoekenspeller, the librarian of the Society with a Hochdeutsch accent
(the spelling of his name appears to be highly variable); Madame Astra Clair,
a medium and only known female member; Fu-Du Manchu, Eastern philosopher;
Comrade Kletsnjet, ghost master (who is probably not human, and perhaps not
even real...); Uche Uche, native American Medicine Man also known as Old
Puf Puf (who keeps trying to use Madame Clair as a servant), and Dr. Scalpatus,
cynic medic in a horned mask.

Profile by Theodoor Westerhof.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Bill Scott notes <I>"The Professor Ambrosius in the comic PEP 1 seems to
be the same Professor Ambrosius that appeared in the 1967 Roman Polanski
film "Dance of the Vampires" (AKA The Fearless Vampire Killers). Not only
do they share the same attributes - super-bravery/ingenuity in the face of
evil - but the cartoon Ambrosius looks very much like the character in the
film played by Irish actor Jack McGowran. </I>
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>So added to the History could be : In the late 19th Century Ambrosius
travelled to Translyvania and attempted to destroy the "King Vampire", Count
Krolock. Unfortunately his mission was an utter failure in that his assistant
was turned into a vampire and Ambrosius unwittingly transported him out of
Transylvania and thus spread the plague of vampirism to the outside world.</I>

<I>See here for details of the film -

While it's by no means certain that the two identically named Professor's
are the same character, it does seem a huge coincindence if, at the minimum,
the comic one wasn't inspired by the movie one.
