<B>History</B>: Adele Blanc-Sec was a freelance writer operating in Paris,
a young woman who was not not afraid to drink, shoot guns, smoke, or shoot
like a man. She lived in a top floor apartment with only a Mummy her great
grand uncle had brought back from his travels for company. In 1911 Paris
was plagued by a sect of demon worshippers who were on a spree of human
sacrifice, killing their enemies atop the Eiffel Tower, until Adele interfered
and defeated the cult. She continued to encounter and battle a variety of
bizarre beings, including mad scientists wanting to resurrect frozen cavemen
as soldiers, an insane telepath who controlled a revived pterodactyl&nbsp;with
his mental powers, Egyptian mummies brought back to life, and a host of other
weird creatures. During one of these adventures <I>(Mimmies on Parade)</I>
Adele was fatally stabbed through the heart, and would have died, had not
a young scientist, aided by Adele's resurrected Mummy, placed her in hibernation.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Adele was finally awoken several years later, having slept through World
War I. Her rescuer was Lucien Brindavoine, a photographer who was no stranger
to weird adventure. Adele and Brindavoine were stalked again by their old
enemies and investigated a conspiracy which led them to uncover the real
reasons behind World War I, as well as other strange ectoplasmic phemenons.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Adele's last recorded adventure took place in 1922, and introduced Adele's
sister, Mireille Pain-Sec

Created by Jacques Tardi. The first Adele Blanc-Sec story was originally
serialized in the daily newspaper "Sud-Ouest" in 1976. It was then collected
in a graphic novel by Belgian publisher Casterman.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Later stories were first serialized in Casterman's monthly comic magazine,
"(A Suivre)", then published as graphic novels.

    La Fleur au Fusil [The Flower in the Rifle] (10 p. story) ("Pilote" No. 743,

Adieu Brindavoine, serialized in 1972 &amp; 1973 in the weekly magazine "Pilote",
told the story of a young photographer in the Europe of 1914. Lucien Brindavoine
gets caught up in a bizarre odyssey that takes him to the Middle East. There,
he encounters a lunatic millionaire, Otto Lindenberg, who is trying to find
a worthy heir to his fortune. The story ends with the beginning of World
War I.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
A later short story sequel, The Flower in the Rifle, was published in "Pilote"
the following year and told more of the long-suffering Brindavoine's wartime
experiences.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
In addition, Momies en Folie (Adele's fourth adventure) served as a sequel
of sorts to another Tardi story, Le Demon des Glaces [The Demon Of The Ice]
(1974), bringing back several of the characters from same to encounter Adele.
The Demon of the Ice, which was released directly in album form by "Pilote"'s
publisher Dargaud in 1974, was a deliberate homage to Jules Verne. It told
the story of mad scientist Carlo Gelati and his secret sea fortress, disguised
as an artificial iceberg. The story takes place in the 1890's, and Gelati's
arch-enemy, Simone Pouffiot, clearly anticipates Adele Blanc-Sec.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
In an interview, Tardi explained that Adele's "death" in Momies en Folie
was necessitated by the onset of World War I. Her feisty nature made it
impossible to provide her with a place in the war. She would not have been
allowed to fight, and could no more have settled for being a nurse, than
she could have remained home rolling bandages. Hence he placed her on ice
for the duration of the war. In The Secret of the Salamander, Tardi deals
with Brindavoine's post-war adventures, leading to Adele's resurrection in
November, 1918.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
The first five Adele Blanc-Sec stories as well as Adieu Brindavoine were
translated by Randy &amp; Jean-Marc Lofficier. They were first serialized
in b&amp;w in Dark Horse's "Cheval Noir" comic, then published as graphic
novels by NBM.
