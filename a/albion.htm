<B>History</B>: Peter Hunter was a history teacher who gained the powers
of a Pendragon (a supernatural force that chooses certain mortals for important
acts) just prior to World War I. As Albion, Peter rallied the British troops
again and again. After the war, the powers seemed to fade, leaving only
youthfulness in their wake. Peter grew older at a slower rate than most but
was careful to hide this fact from his friends. In recent years, the powers
have been returned to Peter and he now recognizes that being Albion is an
important part of his life. Though he is not the team's official leader,
his words carry great weight within the group.
