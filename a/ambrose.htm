<B>History</B>: Merlin Ambrose is the legendary Merlin of King Arthur's Court.
The son of the devil (a.k.a. Lord Oblivion), he ages slowly and backwards.
When we first meet him, he is in the form of a ten year old boy, and has
now been going by his surname for centuries. He sent the Elemental Morningstar
on a quest to recover a magical sword from a&nbsp;dragon, as she would be
immune to the dragon's fire. Much later he became an ally of the Elementals
after the assassin Fantasia Faust was sent to kill them. During the time
they spent together he fell in love with Morningstar, and when the villainous
Shapeshifter drove her to the brink of suicide Ambrose stepped in to stop
her killing herself.

Taking adult form he proposed, and she accepted. They were married shortly
afterwards.
