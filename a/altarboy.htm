<B>History</B>: Altar Boy's father had been a small town doctor who had died
in poverty, his sacrifices for the local community unnoticed. Determined
not to have a similar fate, his son moved to Astro City, where he hoped his
athletic skills and fighting ability would allow him to become a superhero's
sidekick, and perhaps one day, a superhero in his own right. He landed himself
a job in a private club whose patrons were superheroes in their civilian
identities. When a supervillain crashed the club and tried to use him as
a hostage, he defeated the crook before any of the gathered heroes had the
opportunity to do so.

This impressive display of potential drew the attention of the
<A HREF="../c/confessr.htm">Confessor</A>, one of the city's dark avenger
of the night-types, who took him on as his sidekick, Altar Boy (a name he
accepted with much chagrin). He trained with the hero for several months,
gradually learning the craft of being a hero and a detective, until the Confessor
died thwarting an alien invasion. Altar Boy, having learned that being a
hero was not about public adoration but about sacrifice, went away for a
year to train, and then returned to Astro City as the new Confessor.
