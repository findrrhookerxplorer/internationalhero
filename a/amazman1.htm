he returned to America to become the heroic Amazing-Man. He had a teen sidekick,
Tommy, the Amazing Kid. His love interest was Zona Henderson, a crime reporter,
and Tommy's big sister. His main foe was the Great Question.

    ALIGN="Left"><B>Comments</B>: Amazing Man was created by Bill Everett (creator
of Namor the Sub-Mariner), who wrote and illustrated his first few appearances.
One of the most notable stories was Everett having Amazing Man (frustrated
by the madness of the human race, etc.) give in - temporarily - to his own
dark side.

Because of his ability to generate a green fog, Amazing Man was also known
on occasion as the Green Mist.
