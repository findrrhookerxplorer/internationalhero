<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Enrique used to be a near Olympic level athlete
and competent martial artist. Years of neglect have made him fat and lazy
with bad knees and poor endurance. Now when faced with a super villain he
has to relay on his quick wit and keen intellect which serve him well since
most super villains are dumber than dirt. As Chuck he had the typical accessories
one expects from non-powered heroes: walkie talkie, body armour, a vest that
fired a sticky line he used to swing and climb, throwing irons etc. He also
had a belt that projected a force field around him allowing him to go toe
to toe with super-powered opponents. The power source for the belt has long
since run down.

    ALIGN="Left">History</B>: As a 14 year old boy Enrique was one of the few
fans of an obscure Los Angeles hero named the
<A HREF="americaknight.htm">American Knight</A>. He attended one of the Knight's
public appearances (the launch of a new car in his toy line) when the Irregulars
(a paramilitary group of conspiracy theorists) attacked. They launched stun
grenades and tear gas into the crowd and in their first volley incapacitated
the Knight. Enrique rushed to his hero's aid, and using the Knight's equipment
managed to hold the attackers at bay until American Knight regained consciousness
and was able to defeat the villains. American Knights PR man was mobbed by
the press who wanted to know who the teen was. Without fully thinking it
through he said that it was American Knight's teen sidekick, and unable to
think of a name he noticed a small grocery store nearby and a sale on chuck
style beef. And so Chuck the Danger Boy was born.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
American Knight was reluctant to take on a sidekick but Enrique's friendly
and gregarious nature won him over. In the following years he became a minor
media celebrity, and formed a teen super hero team the Wild Ones. He also
noticed the American Knight's growing dissatisfaction with being a super
hero and tried his best to cheer up his gloomy partner.

<IMG SRC="actionfolksinger3.jpg" WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="250" ALIGN="Right">One
day they where attacked by a giant robot. It's origin and maker remain a
mystery. What is known is that it nearly killed Enrique and that American
Knight and the robot disappeared in a fiery explosion. No body was ever found.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Enrique tried to carry on but discovered he was no good at being a solo hero.
Disillusioned he gave up the super hero biz and got on with his life, eventually
becoming a traveling folk singer. Recently someone has given away his former
secret identity over the Internet, which has complicated his life immensely.
