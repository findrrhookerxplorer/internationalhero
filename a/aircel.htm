Aircel began as a Canadian based insulation company operating out of Ottawa,
Aircel Insulation. However when the government contracts ran out foreman
Barry Blair, an aspiring comic book writer, convinced the owner to turn the
warehouse into a studio and transform Aircel into a comics company. Gathering
around him a variety of talented people, including the future Hulk and
<A HREF="../p/pitt.htm">Pitt</A>&nbsp;artist Dale Keown, Blair began a line
of titles largely dominated by fantasy comics. However financial problems
(which Blair puts down to his business manager's mishandling of company monies)
caused Blair to strike a deal with Scott Rosenberg, owner of
<A HREF="../m/malibu.htm">Malibu Graphics</A>, whereby the latter company
would be "lent" Aircel to publish a number of titles, in return for a financial
assist paying off the debts Aircel had generated. Eventually those debts
were paid off, and Blair, dissatisfied with the kind of title Aircel was
now associated with (such as sex comics) quit the company, handing it over
to Malibu. When Malibu was bought by <A HREF="../m/marvelco.htm">Marvel</A>
in the mid-90's, they gained ownership of a number of Aircel's (non-creator
owned) lines, which led to Marvel being the credited company when Men in
Black was made into a movie.

(Much of the above information about the history of Aircel Comics is gleaned
from an interview given by Bill Blair to Joseph M. McDonald, available to

Aircel also assisted <A HREF="../s/silvline.htm">Silverline Comics</A> for
a while, publishing a number of their titles - more details about that on
the Silverline page. They also reprinted some of the Australian

appearances in Cyclone Presents.
