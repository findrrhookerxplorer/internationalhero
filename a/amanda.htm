<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Amanda is an immortal, capable of healing virtually
any wound (except those to the throat) in minutes. Even if a wound is instantly
fatal, she will come back to life a short while later. The only way to
permanently end her life is to decapitate her. This leads to Immortals having
massive sword (and axe) fights with one another. Certain rules have evolved
over the millennia: the fights must only be between two Immortals - third
parties cannot interfere once battle is joined; and no Immortal can fight
on Holy Ground. Like other Immortals, she doesn't age.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Amanda can also sense the presence of other immortals, although she only
gets a vague sense of their proximity, not where or who they are. When she
kills other immortals through decapitation, she receives their life essence
in the form of a "Quickening", a sort of electrical light show. Centuries
of practice have made her an adept swordswoman.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: More than a thousand years ago Amanda was a petty thief in
Europe, until she died and came back to life. She was found by Rebecca, who
explained to her that she was an Immortal, unable to die from natural means.
Rebecca, equally immortal, taught Amanda what she would need to know to survive,
when you didn't age, had to hide among mortals who might envy or fear you,
and had to be prepared to face other Immortals who wished to take your head,
and thus give you the final death. After several years together, Amanda struck
out on her own, although she and Rebecca would reunite several times over
the centuries that followed.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Roughly a century later Amanda became the mentor, when she discovered Kenneth,
a ten year old who had recently died. He would be condemned to never grow
any older, and to be the prey of stronger Immortals, but for Amanda he was
like the child she could never have. She taught him to use guile and cunning
to make up for his lack of physical strength.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
In the 1500s Amanda and Rebecca were travelling together when they first
met a relatively young Immortal, Duncan MacLeod, the Highlander. Although
she didn't know it, Duncan was to be one of the most important people in
her life, and over the centuries they would grow to have strong feelings
for him. However their first meeting set the tone for their relationship,
when she stole his money from him.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Through the centuries Amanda lived by larceny, enjoying the excitement of
being a thief more than actually needing the money. She would run into Duncan
from time to time, usually they would sleep together, then she would run
off having either robbed him, or left him to face the blame for her stealing
from someone else. In the 1920s she enjoyed a spree of bank robberies with
fellow Immortal Cory Raines, racing across America stealing and dying in
shoot-outs with the cops, then being dug from their graves by an annoyed
Duncan, only to force him to dig them out again a few months later when the
two crooks repeated the whole escapade.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
It wasn't until the 1990s that Amanda showed any sign of a moral maturation,
when she began to consider giving up crime. She teamed up with a detective
and pre-Immortal called Nick Wolfe, and the two formed a partnership, enjoying
a number of adventures together. She was last seen becoming his mentor after
he suffered his first death and discovered he was Immortal.
