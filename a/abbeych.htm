Abbey Chase was an expert on antiquities and how to procure them, often for
the highest bidder. Considered by many in her field to be a thief and a pirate,
she travelled the world on behalf of her clients, searching out artifacts.
Her skills brought her to the attention of Deuce, a "retired" spy, who recruited
her for his "Danger Girl" team of operatives. Although at first unsure of
whether she wished to be part of the group, Abbey has since become a valued
member of the squad.
