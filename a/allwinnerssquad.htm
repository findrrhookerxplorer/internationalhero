The All Winners Squad was Timely Comics first true superhero team, put together
from a number of it's individual heroes who had all held their own strips.
They seemed to be gathered as a response to DC Comics Justice Society of
America. Introduced as a team in All Winners Squadron #19 (the previous 18
issues had contained solo adventures of Timely's top heroes), there was no
explanation at the time for why these heroes had suddenly decided to work
together. That would come years later, when Roy Thomas ret-conned virtually
the same heroes as being a group formed during the war, under the name "The
Invaders", gathered by the Allies to battle the Axis forces. In this new
backstory, it became clear that the team had tried to stay together after
the war, under a suitable new name (no post-WWII Invading). Other heroes
who had appeared in All Winners Comics, but not as part of the Squad, were
retroactively given membership, and since Silver Age continuity had both
Captain America and Bucky MIA before the end of the War (and hence the formation
of the Squad), it was established that all of their post-War adventures could
be attributed to other men wearing their costumes.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
The team only appeared twice during the Golden Age, debuting in All Winners
Comics #19, and then bowing out in All Winners Comics #21 (Winter 1946) -
it seems there was no #20 of the title. The cause of this was down to a common
practice of the era, that of retitling an existing comic rather than cancelling
one and launching a replacement (registering a brand new comic cost money,
retitling didn't). Thus All Winners Comics became All Teen Comics as of #20,
and the title effectively ended...only to be briefly revived when Young Allies
Comics finished on #20, and became All Winners Comics for #21. In the history
above, the two Golden Age original appearances are marked with (ga), to make
them stand out from the later additions to the canon.

In the modern version of Marvel history, the All Winners Squadron holds the
important place as being the first post-War gathering of such heroes. They
were stated as operating between 1946 and 1949, by which time many of the
members had retired or gone missing. Other wartime allies of the group would
go on to form the covert agency known as the V-Battalion. Other heroes would
spring up to fill the void left when the Squad disbanded - the G-Men (a.k.a.
as the 1950's Avengers), the Monster Hunters, and the First Line, who would
bridge the gap between the break-up of the Squad and the formation of modern
groups such as the Avengers and Fantastic Four.
