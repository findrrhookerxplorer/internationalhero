<B>History</B>: Born out of wedlock after her father Abraham Whistler had
lost his original family to a vampire attack, Abigail Whistler hunted him
down when she came of age; learning of his quest, she insisted on following
in his footsteps, becoming one of the Nightstalkers, a group who provided
technical assistance and support to Whistler and his protege Blade. Abigail
also hunted vampires personally, and at some point rescued unwilling vampire
Hannibal King from captivity as Danika Talos' "vampire cabana boy." After
King was successfully cured of his vampirism, he became Abigail's hunting
partner. When her father was slain and Blade captured by the police after
the vampires set them up, Abigail and King rescued him from custody, and
later, after the Nightstalkers had been devastated by Dracula, she and King
assisted Blade in destroying Danika Talos' vampire coterie, slaying Dracula,
and releasing the vampire-killing Daystar virus.

<B>Comments</B>: Created by David S. Goyer, inspired by the Marvel Comics
character Frank Drake. Goyer originally intended to use Frank Drake, the
comic book descendent of Dracula and partner to both Hannibal King and Blade;
he then decided to make the character female, "Frankie Drake," before finally
modifying his original idea to make the character the daughter of Blade's
movie partner, Whistler.
