<B>History</B>: "Many men are born outside their century; Esau Cairn was
born outside his epoch. Neither a moron nor a low-class primitive, possessing
a mind well above the average, he was, nevertheless, distinctly out of place
in the modern age. I never knew a man of intelligence so little fitted for
adjustment in a machine-made civilization. He was of a restless mold, impatient
of restraint and resentful of authority. Not by any means a bully, he at
the same time refused to countenance what he considered to be the slightest
infringement on his rights. He was primitive in his passions, with a gusty
temper and a courage inferior to none on this planet. His life was a series
of repressions. Even in athletic contests he was forced to hold himself in,
lest he injure his opponents. Esau Cairn was, in short, a freak--a man whose
physical body and mental bent leaned back to the primordial.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Born in the Southwest, of old frontier stock, he came of a race whose
characteristics were inclined toward violence, and whose traditions were
of war and feud and battle against man and nature. The mountain country in
which he spent his boyhood carried out the tradition. Contest--physical
contest--was the breath of life to him. Without it he was unstable and uncertain.
Because of his peculiar physical make-up, full enjoyment in a legitimate
way, in the ring or on the football field was denied him. His career as a
football player was marked by crippling injuries received by men playing
against him, and he was branded as an unnecessarily brutal man, who fought
to maim his opponents rather than win games. This was unfair. The injuries
were simply resultant from the use of his great strength, always so far superior
to that of the men opposed to him. Cairn was not a great sluggish lethargic
giant as so many powerful men are; he was vibrant with fierce life, ablaze
with dynamic energy. Carried away by the lust of combat, he forgot to control
his powers, and the result was broken limbs or fractured skulls for his
opponents. It was for this reason that he withdrew from college life, unsatisfied
and embittered, and entered the professional ring. Again his fate dogged
him. In his training-quarters, before he had had a single match, he almost
fatally injured a sparring partner. Instantly the papers pounced upon the
incident, and played it up beyond its natural proportions. As a result Cairn's
license was revoked.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Bewildered, unsatisfied, he wandered over the world, a restless Hercules,
seeking outlet for the immense vitality that surged tumultuously within him,
searching vainly for some form of life wild and strenuous enough to satisfy
his cravings, born in the dim red days of the world's youth. Of the final
burst of blind passion that banished him for ever from the life wherein he
roamed, a stranger, I need say little. It was a nine-days' wonder, and the
papers exploited it with screaming headlines. It was an old story--a rotten
city government, a crooked political boss, a man chosen, unwittingly on his
part, to be used as a tool and serve as a puppet. Cairn, restless, weary
of the monotony of a life for which he was unsuited, was an ideal tool--for
a while. But Cairn was neither a criminal nor a fool. He understood their
game quicker than they expected, and took a stand surprisingly firm to them,
who did not know the real man.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Yet, even so, the result would not have been so violent if the man who had
used and ruined Cairn had any real intelligence. Used to grinding men under
his feet and seeing them cringe and beg for mercy, Boss Blaine could not
understand that he was dealing with a man to whom his power and wealth meant
nothing. Yet so schooled was Cairn to iron self-control that it required
first a gross insult, then an actual blow on the part of Blaine, to rouse
him. Then for the first time in his life, his wild nature blazed into full
being. All his thwarted and repressed life surged up behind the clenched
fist that broke Blaine's skull like an eggshell and stretched him lifeless
on the floor, behind the desk from which he had for years ruled a whole district.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Cairn was no fool. With the red haze of fury fading from his glare, he realized
that he could not hope to escape the vengeance of the machine that controlled
the city. It was not because of fear that he fled Blaine's house. It was
simply because of his primitive instinct to find a more convenient place
to turn at bay and fight out his death fight. So it was that chance led him
to my observatory. He would have left, instantly, not wishing to embroil
me in his trouble, but I persuaded him to remain and tell me his story. I
had long expected some catastrophe of the sort. That he had repressed himself
as long as he did, shows something of his iron character. His nature was
as wild and untamed as that of a maned lion. He had no plan--he simply intended
to fortify himself somewhere and fight it out with the police until he was
riddled with lead.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
I at first agreed with him, seeing no better alternative. I was not so naive
as to believe he had any chance in the courts with the evidence that would
be presented against him. Then a sudden thought occurred to me, so fantastic
and alien, and yet so logical, that I instantly propounded it to my companion.
I told him of the Great Secret, and gave him proof of its possibilities.
In short, I urged him to take the chance of a flight through space, rather
than meet the certain death that awaited him. And he agreed. There was no
place in the universe which would support human life. But I had looked beyond
the knowledge of men, in universes beyond universes. And I chose the only
planet I knew on which a human being could exist--the wild, primitive, and
strange planet I named Almuric. Cairn understood the risks and uncertainties
as well as I. But he was utterly fearless--and the thing was done. Esau Cairn
left the planet of his birth, for a world swimming afar in space, alien,
aloof, strange."
