<B>History</B>: Able to summon hordes of angels to smite wrong-doers, Angel
Summoner teamed up with fellow crimefighter BMX Bandit, but soon came to
realise his partner found it galling that they solved every problem by sending
in a host of celestial superbeings. Trying to bolster his partner's self-esteem,
Angel Summoner promised to let BMX Bandit deal with the next opponent without
using the angels. Unfortunately, this proved to be a small army of heavily
armed and fanatical terrorists holed up in an isolated building. Clearly
realising he had bitten off more than he could chew, BMX Bandit suggested
that maybe they could use the angels, but Angel Summoner insisted that a
promise was a promise, and that BMX Bandit was up to handling the threat.
Terrified, BMX Bandit rode his bike in a death defying leap from the rooftop
he was on to the terrorist's building, noting with growing glee that he was
successfully traversing the huge gap, making the greatest BMX leap in recorded
history. However his joy died instantly when he realised that Angel Summoner
was covertly using invisible angels to keep him airborne. His confidence
falsely restored, BMX Bandit demanded the angels be withdrawn; Angel Summoner
reluctantly did so, and BMX Bandit immediately plummeted to his death. Angel
Summoner soon got a new partner, the horse-riding Gymkhana Girl

<B>History</B>: An extremely skilled bike rider, BMX Bandit decided to utilise
his astounding abilities to fight crime, catching villains by surprise by
riding into their midst and disarming them with daring wheelies. He teamed
up with Angel Summoner, but found it increasingly frustrating that his partner
would unintentionally but inevitably easily overcome every opponent by sending
in hordes of angels to overpower them, leaving BMX Bandit with nothing to
do. Realising his partner's disquiet, Angel Summoner promised to let BMX
Bandit deal with the next problem; sadly that proved to be taking out heavily
armed terrorists by leaping across a huge gap between buildings. BMX Bandit
gamely tried, but realised midway through his death-defying leap that Angel
Summoner was using invisible angels to keep him in the air. Angrily BMX Bandit
insisted his partner remove the angels; Angel Summoner reluctantly did so,
and BMX Bandit fell to his death.
