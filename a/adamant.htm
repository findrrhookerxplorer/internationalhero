  <B>History</B>: Adam Adamant was a Victorian/Edwardian adventurer who fought
  crime and solved mysteries. In 1902 the woman he loved, Louise, was kidnapped
  and Adam raced to her rescue, only to discover the abduction had been a ruse,
  luring him into an ambush. Captured by his arch enemy, the Face, Adam was
  shocked to discover Louise was the villain's mistress. Rather than kill Adam,
  the Face thought to inflict a much crueler fate; he injected his foe with
  a drug which would grant him an eternal life, but frozen, unable to move,
  a living death.

  In 1966 workmen discovered Adam and he was revived. Georgina Jones, whose
  grandfather once met Adam, had grown up listening to tales of his adventures,
  and became his guide in the strange new world he found himself in. Another
  ally was his butler, William Simms. Though the world had changed much, Adam
  soon found villainy was eternal, and returned to crimefighting; 1960's criminals
  swiftly discovered why he had been a scourge of villainy in his own era.
  However the Face also subsequently returned to menace the world, renewing
  their old feud.
