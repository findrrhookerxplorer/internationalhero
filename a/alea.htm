<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Alea's body is coated with a red exo-skeleton which
grants her a level of invulnerability and superhuman strength.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Alea lived a relatively normal life with her boyfriend Guy
on his family ranch in Oregon until the day a Daemonite killer turned up
to slaughter him on orders of it's D'rahn masters. The aliens revealed that
the Blackfoot family also carried alien blood in their veins, being part
Kherubim, and that their races had been mortal enemies for centuries. Pildra,
one of the D'rahn, slew Guy, then "enlightened" Alea, transforming her into
a being covered in a crystalline exoskeleton. Before she could do anything
more to her victim, Wildcore turned up, and the D'rahn fled.

The team of heroes took the grieving Alea with them when they left, and offered
her a new life as part of their group. She stayed with them for some time,
gradually getting over her loss, and was with Wildcore when they tried to
stop a breakout at Purgatory Max. Along with most of the rest of the team,
she is believed to have died there.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
As a result, her skin has become encased in a red crystalline exoskeleton.
Exactly how she has been affected is unknown, but she seems to have enhanced
strength and invulnerability. Whether Alea has been mentally changed beyond
the trauma of evolving and the death of her boyfriend is not known at this
time.

Branum is still in the process of running tests to assess the extent of her
powers but it is slow-going as Guy's death have left deeper wounds than expected.
Every now and then she throws a fit and starts calling for Guy, so much so
that Brawl has to be around to restrain her as it seems only his strength
can match hers.
