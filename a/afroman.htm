<B>History</B>: <I>(Enter - Metalhead!)</I> Afro Man and
<A HREF="../c/captainmassachusetts.htm">Captain Massachusetts</A> were sitting
in their council flat, arguing about music (the Captain was playing Cliff
Richards, while Afro Man preferred&nbsp;James Brown), when their receptionist
<A HREF="../r/randyhogan.htm">Randy Hogan</A> was shocked by a vision of
a nearly naked, beautiful woman which appeared in front of him. The two heroes
identified the intruder as <A HREF="../l/ladyxanadu.htm">Lady Xanadu</A>,
just as she warned them their friend and ally
<A HREF="../s/supertrouper.htm">Super Trouper</A> was locked in deadly combat
with <A HREF="../m/metalhead.htm">Metalhead</A>. Instantly, the Funk Commandos
rushed to their comrade's assistance...slightly delayed as the next bus into
town wasn't due for another ten minutes.

<IMG SRC="afroman3.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="280" ALIGN="Left"><I>(Lost in
Music)</I> As the the Commandos arrived to aid their ally, their battle with
the rampaging headbanger was interrupted by the arrival of Disco Inferno,
wearing the Strobe Light of Funkiness medallion that was normally worn by
Discotron. The Commandos demanded to know what had happened to their leader,
but instead of an answer, Disco Inferno engulfed them in a strobing light
which teleported them to another dimension. Eventually escaping their
imprisonment, the Commandos found they had returned to an alternate Earth,
several decades in the past. When they finally got back to their original
time (if not their original world) they approached their old receptionist,
<A HREF="../r/randyhogan.htm">Randy Hogan</A>, to seek his assistance.
