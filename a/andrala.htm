<B><IMG SRC="andraia1.jpg" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="389" ALIGN="Left">History</B>:
AndrAIa was a game sprite who took a shine to
<A HREF="../e/enzo.htm">Enzo</A>&nbsp;while her game was in play in Mainframe.
Faking her icon so that she appeared to belong to Mainframe, not the game,
she managed to remain behind when the game departed. She remained Enzo's
greatest proponent thereafter, and when <A HREF="../b/bob.htm">Bob</A>, the
city's guardian, was lost to the Web, she accompanied Enzo into the games
when the young sprite tried to defend the city in his place. Like Enzo she
was trapped when they finally lost a game, and in order to survive the two
of them altered their icons so that they could travel from system to system
within games. For years they searched for a way home, growing up into adults
as they did so. Eventually they managed to locate the missing Bob and find
their way back to Mainframe.
