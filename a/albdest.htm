    ALIGN="Left"><B>History</B>: Albert Destine was born in the mid-14th century,
the son of Adam Destine and genie-like entity Elayth. Like his elder siblings
Kay and Thaddeus, and younger siblings to come, he possessed superhuman powers,
in his case psychic abilities and the power to heal. Still a young man, he
tried and painfully failed to stem the Black Death's inevitable spread across
Europe, and emotionally broken, was taken to heal at Tibet's Shalu Monastery
by his father and brother. En route they were attacked by the rogue Inhuman
Tral and his mind-controlled "zombie" slaves, but when Thaddeus was slain
in the fight, an enraged Albert turned his healing powers into reverse and
killed Tral, an act which would haunt him into the modern day. Studying mystical
techniques and embracing spirituality, he became a monk and developed his
healing power, which by the modern day could restore individuals even from
half a planet away.
