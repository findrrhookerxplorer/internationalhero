<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: After a century working for Hellsing Knights, Alucard
became one of the most powerful beings in this planet: he can heal absolutely
any wounds, even after being literally shot to pieces. He doesn't care about
crosses, Holy Water, nor decapitation - he does worry slightly about silver
bullets, as they take some time to regenerate from. He's got psychic skills,
like the famous third eye, as well as hypnosis. He can walk under the sun,
but he hates it. He can fly, disappear at will, change into mist, bats, worms,
shadows, blood stains, monstrous dogs, or horrible unknown beasts with hundreds
eyes and tentacles. He can change others into vampires (as he did with Victoria),
and possesses superhuman strength and senses. In fact, he's so powerful that
his master limits his powers using the "Cromwell Initiative," which consists
of several levels of "release states," lower numbers being more powerful.
At Level Zero, he takes the appearance of Vlad Tepes, as he was hundreds
of years ago, with armour and a beard, and can summon an army of all the
people he has ever drunk the blood of, including Turkish janissaries, medieval
knights, and many soldiers. He's got two " friends ", Casull and Jackal,
enormous guns that shoot silver bullets.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Casull was Alucard's first gun. The barrel is 390mm long, for a 1km range.
It has a 6 bullets magazine. The bullets were basically 454 Casull (which
are twice more powerful than 44 Magnum), but they got customized: each bullet
is a 13mm explosive steel rounds, alloyed with silver melted from a Lanchester
Cathedral Cross. 
<P ALIGN=Justify>
After being beaten in battle by Father Anderson, Alucard decided his enemies'
firepower exceeded his own, and accordingly had Walter, his teammate, design
a new weapon, the Hakonen Cannon, which he dubbed Jackal. This black monster
has a 390mm long barrel, and weighed 16kg. It's too powerful for a human
to handle, but Alucard uses it with one hand. The magazine has not been changed,
but the 6 bullets are now quicksilver-filled, with a whole new explosive
technology. It's almost has powerful has a rocket launcher (maybe more) and
a very few creatures in the world can withstand it's shots.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: When he was defeated by Abraham Hellsing in the 19th century,
Alucard became the Hellsing family's bodyguard, and the first hunter for
the Hellsing Knights. During that period, he learned to increase his power
to reach invincibility. In 1945, the Royal Army sent him to Germany with
a young human soldier, Walter C. Dornez. Their mission: destroy the Millennium's
vampire army. They accomplished it, but Millennium survived and re-established
operations in South America.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
At the end of the war, Alucard decided to take advantage of the political
chaos to break his contract with Hellsing and leave England. He failed, and
got killed by Lord Hellsing, the only one who could do it. But one day, Lord
Hellsing died, letting his teenage daughter take control of the organization.
The young lady had many enemies, and one of them was her uncle. He tried
to murder her, and she had no other choice than hide in the underground of
the castle. That's where she discovered the dead body of Alucard. Her uncle
shot her in the shoulder, and some blood flew into Alucard's mouth, bringing
him back to " life ". To thank her, he gave his protection.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Now, twenty years have passed, and Alucard finally discovered Millennium's
secret base. But the best Vatican's vampire hunter, Father Anderson, is after
him&#133;
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Comments</B>: Created by Kohta Hirano, inspired by characters from Bram
Stoker's <I>Dracula</I>.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
In the TV show, the story is almost the same as the manga version listed
above, except that instead of Millennium, Alucard fights Incognito, whose
appearance is never explained. But both the manga and the TV show agree about
Alucard: even if he works for the " nice guys ", Alucard is a psycho, a sadistic
and pretentious murderer who loves fighting, death and blood. As he says
in the manga, "Ah... the scent of death. The fragrance of war!"
