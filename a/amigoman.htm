<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Amigoman is a skilled martial artist. He still hears
and sees visions of his Gramps, advising him and watching over him, although
whether this is a genuine ghostly visitation or simply the product of his
guilt and loss playing on his mind, is unclear.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Antonio Alvarado came from a good, middle-class family. But
as he grew older he fell into bad company, joined a gang, and looked like
he was about to throw his life away. His grandfather changed all that.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Alberto Alvarado, called Gramps by his grandson, was a retired army sergeant.
He took Antonio in when the boy was fifteen and turned him around, away from
life as a gang-banger, and into school work and martial arts. Antonio graduated
school with excellent results, a straight "A" student, and went to college
to study law. He was well on his way to becoming a successful lawyer when
tragedy struck. Gramps was mugged and died shortly afterwards, a victim or
random street violence. The police investigated, but couldn't find any leads,
and in the end had other crimes to worry about. Determined not to let his
grandfather's murderers slip through the cracks, Antonio decided to track
them down himself.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
He quit law school and moved back home. To pay the bills, and to give himself
a way of keeping his ear to the street, he became a high school teacher.
And he started to use his old street contacts to try and hunt down the people
who had killed Alberto. Since his pursuit of justice might take him over
the line with the law, he started to wear a mask when he went out at night,
prowling the street searching for leads. Although he was only really interested
in finding the killers, he began to come across other crimes and other innocents
being endangered, and his sense of justice wouldn't allow him to stand by
and just watch. Gradually he slipped unintentionally into the role of vigilante.
His actions stopping street crimes drew public attention, and he was labelled
a friend of the city by many, dubbed Amigoman, the Latin Avenger. But all
Antonio really wants is to find the men who murdered Gramps, bring them to
justice, then hang up his mask and return to law school.
