<B>First Appearance: </B>"W3", Shonen Magazine (manga, 1965)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History: </B>Feeling humanity needed extra help maintaining law and order,
Galactic Control dispatched three of their top agents, Patrol W3, to the
primitive planet. The trio were told that if mankind could not be made to
embrace peace, and they deemed that the Earthlings warlike ways might eventually
threaten the rest of the galaxy, then they should report this back, and in
doing so doom the planet.

Once they reached Earth, each member of the team assumed what they hoped
would be an inconspicuous local form. Team leader Major Boko became a rabbit,
science officer Noko chose a horse, while the aggresive Polo, who had already
pre-judged mankind and wanted to blow them up, picked a duck. In these guises
they came into contact with a young boy Shinichi Hoshi, whose brother was
a top agent for the international law enforcement Phoenix Bureau. Shinichi
soon came to know his friends' secret, and when his brother needed help,
the W3 would be asked to assist. The team would travel around the world in
a giant wheel, solving problems and thwarting criminals.

For roughly a year the group worked on Earth, but their reports only served
to convince the Galactic League's governing body, the Galactic Control, that
Earth was unsalvageable and should be eliminated for the good of all other
planets. Learning of this, Shinichi convinced his friends to take him to
their homeworld, where he pled the case for his species. His cries did not
fall on deaf ears, and mankind was given a stay of execution, and would be
allowed to live until Shinichi had reached adulthood.

<B>Comments: </B>Created by Osamu Tezuka, and produced by his company, Mushi
Productions. The show lasted fifty-two episodes, each twenty-five minutes
long.
