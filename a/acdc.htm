from their respective hands, which they can discharge into an opponent so
long as both twins touch the victim simultaneously. They can also fly.

<B>History</B>: AC-DC were conjoined twins who were transformed by the
reality-bending Jaspers' Warp which engulfed the U.K. several years back.
Like other "Warpies", they were tracked down by government agency R.C.X.
(the Resources Control Executive) and taken into the agency's custody. They
became part of the Cherubim, the first combat ready squad the agency trained.
Fearing for the safety of their charges if the plans of their superior Nigel
Orpington-Smythe went ahead, several R.C.X. agents, led by Agents Michael
and Gabriel, spirited the children away from the agency. They took them to
Braddock Manor, to enlist the aid of Captain Britain (Brian Braddock), figuring
that he could lend them much needed protection, both physical and politically.
However the agents' decision not to fully inform the hero of their situation
meant he was reluctant to help, and while they argued, the Cherubim were
released from the van they were being transported in by Meggan, a young empathic
metamorph staying at the Manor. They fought Captain Britain and his allies,
Betsy Braddock and Captain U.K., but were swiftly overpowered. In the confusion
afterwards, the Cherubim, including AC-DC, went awol; the other Warpies moved
into Braddock Manor. The Cherubim ended up in London, where they briefly
fell under the influence of the Fagan-like Uncle Lex, and joined his Parasites
(a Warpie gang). Later R.C.X. tracked them down and brought them back into
the fold. Working for Orpington-Smythe, AC-DC and their friends fought Captain
Britain and Meggan again, and captured them. Orpington-Smythe was later deposed
as head of R.C.X., and control of the agency fell to Michael and Gabriel,
and their ally from the Weird Happenings Organisation Alistair Stuart. This
new era was sadly short-lived; the ruthless Black Air agency kidnapped the
Warpies and ran experiments on them, dissecting many. AC-DC was among the
survivors subsequently rescued by Mastermind, the computer intelligence from
Braddock Manor who had once looked after many of the Warpies. Mastermind
saved them, but because his programming had been corrupted by Kang the Conqueror,
he turned them into an army which he led into battle against Otherworld.
Captain Britain led a team of heroes to save the realm, and eventually used
the power of the Sword of Might to transform the Warpies, AC and DC included,
back into normal humans.
