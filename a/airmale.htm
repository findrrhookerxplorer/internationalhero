<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Airmale is permanently lighter than air, but uses
a gravity belt to allow him to increase that force on himself, allowing him
to walk normally when he wants.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Biology professor Ken Stevens has been trying to develop
a "flight fluid" which will make things lighter than air. While getting ready
to attend a costume party he spills some of the fluid on his hand, and becomes
lighter than air. Since he is already in a costume at the time, he decides
to become the crimefighter Airmale.
