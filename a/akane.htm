<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Akane has incredible, near superhuman strength,
is clumsy (by local standards anyway, which still makes her pretty spry compared
to a normal person), and a very good master of martial arts. She has the
ability to pull mallets from thin air with which to beat Ranma (anime, not
manga) whenever she gets angry, which is often. She's an incredibly bad cook.

<B><IMG SRC="akane2.jpg" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="450" ALIGN="Left">History</B>:
Akane is the youngest daughter of martial arts master Soun Tendou, and an
expert fighter in her own right. She is at the stage that while she is starting
to get crushes on men (especially more mature ones like her family's doctor),
she finds boys annoying and refuses to admit she likes any of them. This
proves to be a problem when her father's old friend
<A HREF="../g/genma.htm">Genma</A> Saotome sends a letter informing the Tendou
family of his imminent arrival, as the two parents had pledged that their
offspring (one of Sounu's daughters and Genma's son
<A HREF="../r/ranma.htm">Ranma</A>) should marry back when the children were
infants. When it transpires that Ranma is cursed, sometimes transforming
into a girl, Akane's elder sisters drop the obligation of marriage onto Akane,
who is less than enamoured with the idea, especially as Ranma has shown himself
to be a better martial artist than her.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Ranma and Akane constantly argue and fight (often physically), and won't
recognize that they are falling in love with each other. Akane gets angry
each time Ranma acts as if he is not in love with her, or when Ranma is near
the other girls that are in love with him (Ukyou, Shampoo and Kodachi). There's
another boy who might have fallen in love with Akane: Tatewaki
<A HREF="../k/kuno.htm">Kunou</A>, a master in Kendo Fighting and chief of
the Furinkhan School's Kendo Team. However, Akane hates Kunou, and each time
Kunou wants to take her in his arms or tries to kiss her, she kicks him away
(showing her incredible strength).
