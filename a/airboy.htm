Having acquired the rights to <A HREF="../h/hillman.htm">Hillman's</A>
properties, in the mid-1980s Eclipse Comics launched a new Airboy series,
which&nbsp;ran for 50 issues.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
The rights to many of the Eclipse characters were bought by
<A HREF="../m/mcfarlan.htm">Todd McFarlane</A>, but though he can use their
version of Airboy, it seems the earlier, Hillman version, is now public domain,
and as a result <A HREF="../m/moonstone.htm">Moonstone Publishing</A> recently
began producing new stories too.
