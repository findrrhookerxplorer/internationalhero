<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>First Appearance</B>: The Daredevils #3 (March 1983)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Alison is a telepath of unspecified power level
(although presumably not greater than her friend Betsy Braddock). She also
appears to be able to see people's auras.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: <I>(bts)</I> Alison Double is recruited into S.T.R.I.K.E.
Psi Division. There she meets several fellow telepaths who make up the division.
When the agency is infiltrated by operatives of the crimelord Vixen, the
Psi Division are the only ones who realise what is happening. The group goes
on the run, Alison amongst them, and Vixen hires the assassin Slaymaster
to hunt them down and silence them.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<IMG SRC="../d/double.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="192" ALIGN="Left"><I>(Daredevils
#3)</I> Alison is in "mind-lock" with another of the division, Kevin, when
Slaymaster catches up with him and murders him. Even though she is some distance
away, she is knocked unconscious by the trauma. Very shortly thereafter Alison
and most of the group hide out at Forbidden Planet, a local comic shop, while
Betsy meets up with her superhero brother Brian, intending to enlist his
aid. Unfortunately, as Alison stands around reading a comic, Slaymaster tracks
them there, and starts to kill them. The killer has cornered the last two,
Tom Lennox and Alison, when rescue arrives, in the form of Betsy's brother,
now in his guise as Captain Britain.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Daredevils #4) </I>Tom cradles Alison in his arms while watching Captain
Britain pound on Slaymaster. He communicates telepathically with his lover,
Betsy; Alison however has once more been rendered insensate by her ordeal.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(bts) </I>Alison and her two fellow survivors take up residence in the
holographically cloaked Braddock Manor.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Daredevils #5) </I>The Special Executive are hired to break into Braddock
Manor and kidnap Captain Britain. Alison, still convalescing from the series
of brutal psychic shocks she has experienced, does not awaken when Cobweb,
one of that mercenary group, enters her room to check on her, before moving
on to their target.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(bts)</I> The fugitives flee the Manor, no longer safe since the Fury's
attack, and make their way into London. They hide from the increasingly
oppressive anti-superhuman Jasper's regime in the basement of an abandoned
house. Alison remains virtually comatose and her health is poor, requiring
others to care for her at all times.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<IMG SRC="aldouble3.jpg" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="344" ALIGN="Right"><I>(Mighty
World of Marvel #8)</I> Captain Britain is cradling the unconscious Alison's
head in his arm and giving her something to drink when Saturnyne and Betsy
return from foraging. He asks them if they managed to get any medicine, since
Alison is "feverish again". After the stressed out fugitives exchange some
heated words, Betsy and Tom take over administering care to their fellow
telepath.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Mighty World of Marvel #9)</I> After Captain Britain has departed to
confront Mad Jim Jaspers, whose mutant powers have turned Britain into a
terrifying police state, the fugitives' hideout is discovered by the Beetles,
armoured agents of the regime. Tom sacrifices his life to try and delay the
hostile force, buying time for his friends to escape. Sadly Betsy and Alison
are captured anyway, downed by an entangling line just before they are forced
to again experience the death of a fellow psi.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(bts)</I> Interred in one of Jasper's camps, the two mentally scarred
telepaths are befriended by fellow inmate Victoria Bentley, an ally of Doctor
Strange and the Black Knight.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Mighty World of Marvel #13) </I>With the death of Jaspers, his regime
collapses and the camp fences are torn down. Victoria Bentley helps her two
friends walk to freedom. Unknown to the three released prisoners, their departure
from the camps is witnessed on Otherworld by Roma, Captain U.K. and Captain
Britain. Roma assures the worried Britain that Victoria is eminently suited
to care for her two charges while their spirits mend.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<IMG SRC="aldouble2.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN="Left"><I>(Mighty
World of Marvel #16) </I>Alison and Betsy return to Braddock Manor, having
spent several months healing under the care of Victoria Bentley. Brian enquires
how Alison feels, and she confirms her health has improved and continues
to do so, thanks to the care their benefactor took of them. Emma Collins,
the Manor's housekeeper, likewise welcomes them home, and then they meet
Meggan, who came to stay during the telepaths' absence. Alison notes that
Meggan's aura is beautiful, "like an irridescent butterfly". Everyone moves
to the living room to watch a television report about the repair and re-opening
of the Manor.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Captain Britain II #8, (fb)) </I>Alison tries to explain to Meggan about
the potential she sees in the vulpine mutant's aura, stating that Meggan
does not need to look like a humanoid bat/wolf-creature. Alison continues
to explain that it was the superstitions of Meggan's people that shaped the
young girl's appearance. Meggan says she doesn't understand, but Alison assures
her that once Meggan does, "the caterpillar will become the butterfly."
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<IMG SRC="aldouble4.jpg" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="194"><I>(Captain
Britain II #5)</I> Extra-dimensional mercenaries once again invade the Manor
late at night. This time it is the Technet on the trail of Kaptain Briton,
counterpart to this dimension's Captain Britain. While the two Captain's
battle, Gatecrasher, the group leader, sends Fascination to collect together
the household, and Elmo, another one of the Technet, dampens Betsy's psi
powers. The group watches as the evenly matched duo smash through floors
and ceilings, and Gatecrasher explains to them her mission. Finally our Earth's
Captain appears to be victorious. Yap confirms the winner to be Earth-616's
hero, but Gatecrasher, wanting to be certain, asks Betsy to confirm the one
standing is her brother. Still woozy from Elmo's dampening, Betsy is unable
to do so. Gatecrasher asks Alison instead, who confirms that he is who he
says he is. The Technet depart with their captive, and Alison tells Emma
that they will get round to clearing the damage in the morning. But Alison
has gotten it wrong - the man who won the battle is the evil counterpart,
not the true Captain Britain.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Captain Britain II #7)</I> Mere minutes later Alison senses that Betsy
is in distress. She races to Betsy's room, only to find the door locked and
Betsy not answering. Meggan is attracted by her shouting, and breaks the
door down. They find Betsy sitting in shock next to the corpse of the pretender,
and the real Captain Britain teleporting back from the dimension the Technet
took him to. Brian tries to comfort his sister and fails, turning instead
to Alison (as someone who might understand what it is like to be in someone's
mind as you telepathically kill them? - Loki). Alison watches as the Mastermind
sends a hologram to dispose of the corpse.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<IMG SRC="aldouble5.jpg" WIDTH="269" HEIGHT="333" ALIGN="Left"><I>(Captain
Britain II #9)</I> RCX has arrived at the Manor, bringing with them the Cherubim,
combat-trained Warpies. After Meggan inadvertently releases the destructive
group, Jeeves wakens Alison and Emma on Captain Britain's orders, and takes
them down into the caves beneath the Manor for safety. Once the battle is
over the non-combatants go outside to see what has happened. Alison is overjoyed
that Meggan has finally understood her earlier message, and transformed herself
into a beauty. Captain Britain is stunned by this change, and Alison snaps
at him that she did try to tell him, between alien visitations and his drunken
sulks. Then she turns her attention back to Meggan.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(bts)</I> Alison is not seen during the period when Betsy helps RCX settle
their superpowered junior charges into the Manor, nor when her friend Betsy
is blinded by Slaymaster while working for RCX as the new Captain Britain.
(see comments)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<I>(Captain Britain II #14)</I> It is Christmas. Alison and RCX agent Gabriel
note how well Betsy has recovered from her recent injuries. A little later
Gabriel and Betsy discuss leaving the Manor, and staying for a while with
Alison in her Swiss chateau. A few days later, the three of them (Alison,
Gabriel and Betsy) celebrate a white Christmas up in the Swiss mountains.

Alison is not seen during the tumultuous events that take place in the grounds
of Braddock Manor in Daredevils #9 through #11. It's a fair bet she sleeps
through the return of Captain Britain with the Special Executive, the arrival
of Captain U.K. and the battle with the Fury. As such, she could arguably
be put as being behind the scenes in those issues, as she was around, just
not "on camera". Similarly Alison is briefly seen in a panel of the story
in Mighty World of Marvel #7, arriving into London with her fellow fugitives.
However this is a visualisation of a story being told by Meggan to her fellow
concentration camp Sue, and so can't be taken as accurate.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
The dates given in the story for Alison and Betsy's release from the camps
is 8th September 1983 (MWOM #13). Their convalescence with Victoria Bentley
is fairly long, as their return to Braddock Manor is dated as being on June
6th 1984 (MWOM #16). While the actual years in which these events happened
are now invalidated by Marvel's sliding timescale, the actual duration dates
could still stand, meaning that Alison and Betsy spent about nine months
recovering from the ordeal they underwent.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Alison isn't seen to be around during the period when RCX settle into the
Manor. Since it is later mentioned that Alison owns a chateau in Switzerland,
I'd suggest that when Braddock Manor became the home for that secret agency
and the Warpie children, Alison, like Captain Britain, decided to depart,
taking up residence overseas. She returned for a visit at Christmas after
her friend was crippled by Slaymaster, and extended an invite to Betsy to
come and stay at her new chateau during the recovery period.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Alison's eyes are probably either poor sighted or sensitive to light, since
she was almost always shown wearing dark glasses. However, contrary to what
several online sites say, Alison is <B>not</B> blind. Wearing glasses most
of the time does not mean you are blind - she's seen reading a comic in her
first appearance.
