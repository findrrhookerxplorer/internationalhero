<B>History</B>: Alamid (Lito Lapid), a supernatural being who dwells among
men, asks the gods to let him stay on earth a little longer. He wants to
prepare humankind for his departure, and he wants to find someone who will
take his place. His request is granted, and Alamid finds an infant floating
on a river. He names him David (Dan Alvaro) and nurtures him to become a
righteous man. When the right time comes, Alamid trains David, and soon after,
he transfers to him all his powers. David is now the new Alamid. He goes
after society&#146;s evil elements, and in the process, he captures both
the fancy and admiration of the people. But, concealed by his superhero costume,
Alamid becomes an enigma to all....
