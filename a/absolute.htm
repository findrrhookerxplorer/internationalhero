<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: The Absolute is a highly intelligent man, who had
"survived a long and incredibly violent existence," a master of weapons and
a ruthless killer (though only as a last resort). With the aid of a "bit
of alien protoplasm" he is also a master of disguise.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: The Absolute was an alien law enforcer who became stranded
on Earth. Allying himself to US General Stack and his daughter Audrey, he
fought both Axis forces and the Communists during the 1940s and 50s, operating
from his Star Chamber, located within a hidden cave deep in the Himalayas,
where he kept several strange glowing jars within this fortress, said to
contain "the souls of the galaxy's deadliest criminals".
<P ALIGN=Justify>
For reasons as yet unrevealed, the Absolute put himself into a state of suspended
animation within "an elaborate sarcophagus" kept in his fortress. Some 20
years later, in October 1973, the Star Chamber was discovered by agents of
a mysterious organisation called Biohost. They kidnapped the helpless Absolute,
taking him to a secret clinic to find out what it took to "make" someone
like him. They also took the glowing jars .... But the Absolute was not held
captive for long, soon escaping.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Back in action after 20 years, The Absolute adopted a new costume, the original
(actually a police uniform) having "a rich tradition on my home world". He
later joined other heroes fighting the Time Being, and was seen to be active
far in the future, in the year 2973.

<B>Comments</B>: Profile by Chris Adams.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
"The Absolute" will be enjoyed by fans of the Archie Goodwin/Walter Simonson
strip "Manhunter", published by DC in the early 1970's. There are several
neat twists and references to that self-contained 7 part story that are not
given away above. 
<P ALIGN=Justify>
It's not just Manhunter though; the "Star Chamber" and the soul jars are
references to Superman's "Fortress of Solitude" and the "Phantom Zone". The
Absolute's status as a stranded "alien marshall" is a composite of the Martian
Manhunter (J'onn Jonzz) and the Silver Age version of Hawkman. This together
with his relationships with Audrey Stack and her father make him more than
just a clone of Paul Kirk.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
The only thing wrong with "The Absolute" is that there is not enough of it!
After appearing in Big Bang #11 and 16, his only other appearances were cameos,
joining the battle against the Time Being (BB #33), and, in a third costume,
adventuring in 2973 (BB # 18 and BB # 22). It is unclear if The Absolute
is based on Earth A or Earth B.
