<B>History</B>: Amazing Girl was a member of Project Youngblood, a team of
superpowered youths who fought crime. They were recruited to capture the
DNAgents, but soon discovered that the people they were after were not criminals.
Banding together, they confronted the people trying to manipulate them. Amazing
Girl died along with the rest of her team trying to shut down a malfunctioning
nuclear reactor soon after.

<B>Comments</B>: Amazing Girl was based on Wonder Girl (later Troia) of DC's
New Teen Titans; the rest of Project Youngblood were likewise versions of
the rest of the Titans. In a nice piece of writer co-operation the issue
of DNAgents where Project Youngblood appeared was paralled the same month
in the New Teen Titans were renamed versions of the DNAgents appeared (as
the ReCombatants). In each case, the guest starring teams gave their lives
to prevent a meltdown.
