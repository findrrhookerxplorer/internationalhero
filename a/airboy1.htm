<B>History</B>: Franciscan monk Brother Francis Martier was a skilled aviator
and inventor as well as being a man of God, and created a unique and highly
maneouverable plane which flew by flapping bat-like wings, Unfortunately,
he crashed and died while testing it. His friend, U.S. government scientist
Davy Nelson, inherited the wreckage, and gave it to his son, Davy Nelson
II, who was a top pilot in spite of his tender years, nicknamed "Airboy."
After repairing the plane, which he dubbed "Birdie," Davy II donned a costume
which had been in Martier's family since the French Revolution, and took
to the air to battle Axis forces. His adventures continued for some time
after the war ended, but eventually he retired, put Birdie into storage,
and founded an aircraft manufacturing company. During the 1980s Davy Nelson
was assassinated by mercenaries from Bogantilla, a small South American nation,
prompting his son, Davy Nelson III, to become the new Airboy.

Although one source says he first appeared in Airfighters Magazine, another
says it's Air Fighters Comics. Likewise, one source says the publisher was
Hillman Comics, and a different source claims Hillman Periodicals. The difference
is probably splitting hairs, but if anyone knows which one it is for sure,
let me know.

In the 1980's Eclipse acquired the rights to the Hillman properties and launched
a new Airboy series.
