<B>History: </B>After the end of the Cold War, there was a necessity for
a weapon or a Force capable of defending - not only the United States of
America, but also a Force that would be available to protect and defend Earth
from Alien invaders! A U.S. Army Special Operations Colonel (Ret.), Tim "Ace"
Watson, chose to select, train, and lead this new Force. Their code name:
Alpha Korps! To get a group capable of intimidating or discouraging off-world
aggressors, Col. Ace spent five long years, screening the best candidates
who manifested signs of possessing the Nucleonic-Anomaly. This rare genetic
trait which is only found in one in every few million people and typically
endows the individual with mutant-like powers, but it requires that the recipient
undergo great mental and physical exhaustion - even beyond normal human endurance
- before this rare genetic trait manifests itself! Thus Alpha Korps was born!

Alpha Korps' higher HQ is The Group, a para-military organization responsible
for the security of the United States and North America - there is a sister
unit northeast of London, England, with the same responsibilities but, of
course, for the European Theater of Operations. The Group is HQed in San
Francisco, California.

AK #2-3 apparently explains why the Empress feels the way she does about
Colonel Ace and Alpha Korps. After the first issue was published by Diversity
Comics, I am informed that the rest of the series (four issues, including
a re-issue of the first) will be coming from Anubis Vampeer Productions (AVP)
in the near future. Details on <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.vampeer.com/\n\nThis file was not retrieved because it was filtered out by your project settings.\n\nWould you like to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.vampeer.com/'">their
