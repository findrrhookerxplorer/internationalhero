<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Miguel is as strong, as agile, as quick and has
as much endurance as a human being can without having super powers. Even
before his time in the military he studied Jeet Kun Do extensively. While
with the Marines he learned electrical engineering, wilderness survival,
and military tactics. He is also a dead shot with a sniper rifle but has
given up the use of fire arms.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Miguel Sanchez grew up in East L.A. Wanting to serve his
country and not having enough extracurricular activities to get into college
he enlisted in the Marine Corps. His plan was to serve his tour get his G.I.
grant and get out. His commanding officer played on his natural patriotism
and convinced him to stay in and join Marine Recon. His natural physical
and mental abilities allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks and soon
he was participating in covert operations in South America. The violence
and bloodshed was too much for him so he resigned his commission and went
to work for his Uncle's toy company.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
It was there he created the action figure AZ-tech. He hoped it would be a
heroic figure that Latino children could look up to but it didn't market
test well as was changed into the American Knight. Since the company didn't
have money to pay a model to make public appearances the naturally fit Miguel
was coerced into playing the part. On his first outing he was attacked by
a new super villain trying to get media attention. He managed to defeat him
by luck but this began the public perception that he was a "real" super hero.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
After that incident he found himself falling into one situation after another
that required him to act like a hero. His exploits fueled sales of his action
figure line and allowed Atlas to turn a nice profit. Once he realized that
the workers at his company (many of whom were undocumented workers) could
finally make a living wage he went along with the P.R. department and even
began acting more like a hero.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Over the years he gained a sidekick (Chuck), helped start the premier west
coast super hero team and gained a reputation in the super hero community
as someone you could count on. He stood out amongst the many west coast heroes,
most of whom where merely doing it for kicks.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Despite all this he still felt like a fraud. He felt like he was being molded
into something he really wasn't. Something gaudy and artificial. He considered
stopping but there where too many people depending on him.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
It was at this time that he and Chuck where attacked by an 8 foot tall robot
during a public appearance. Chuck, was nearly killed and he was badly injured.
He and the robot faced off in an abandoned tenement. He had sent Chuck to
evacuate the squatters while he tried something desperate. As Chuck got the
last of them out there was a terrible explosion. No remains of the robot
or Miguel where recovered.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Atlas toys tried to Replace Miguel with Lee Stanley, a stuntman. Chuck,
considering this an affront to Miguel&#146;s memory attacked Lee at a press
conference claiming he was a super villain trying to taint the Knight's memory.
He exposed the fake and confirmed for the press that American Knight was
indeed dead. Since the American Knight action figures where the only thing
they made that sold well Atlas toys folded in a year. Chuck gave up being
a super hero and the mystery of what really happened to the American Knight
is still unsolved.
