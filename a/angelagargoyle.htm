<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Like all gargoyles her strength is superhuman. She
has wings that allow her to glide, not fly, on the wind. During the day,
she, like all gargoyles, turns to stone. This allows her to heal faster then
humans. Also, she does not age while she "sleeps." However, she is vulnerable
during the day.

<B>History</B>: Born to a clan of gargoyles who traditionally protected the
Scottish Castle Wyvern, Angela had not yet hatched from her egg when the
castle was sacked by vikings. Before being frozen in stone, her father, Goliath,
secured the promise of the lady of the castle, Princess Katherine, to protect
the eggs. The princess, along with the sorcerer, The Magus, and a boy named
Tom took the eggs with them as they fled the castle. At first, they took
refuge in the castle of a relative of Princess Katherine, but were soon forced
to leave. Realizing that anywhere man lived, the eggs would be in danger,
the Magus used his powers to take them to the Isle of Avalon, the same island
on which King Arthur slept waiting to be awakened. Time passed and the eggs
hatch. Since humans instead of gargoyles raised them, they were give names
(which traditionally gargoyles do not have), and for the most part, they
lived peacefully. The peace was finally broken when they were attacked by
the Archmage, a sorcerer who had a grudge against the clan. Many of the clan
were killed or wounded in the initial confrontation. Tom, who had been appointed
the Guardian of the Eggs, left in search of help. Due to the magical nature
of Avalon, it had been a mere twenty years for them, while for the outside
world a millennium had passed.

Tom was taken to New York where Goliath and his clan had reawakened. Securing
the help of Goliath, the gargoyle beast Bronx, and their human friend Elisa
Maza, they returned to the isle. It was then that Angela met her biological
father, though Goliath did not tell her as it was traditional for gargoyles
to be raised by the clan as a whole. Together they fought against not only
the Archmage, but also a trio of fairy witches known as the Weird Sisters
who had magically enslaved Demona and the human warrior Macbeth to their
will. With the aid of a reawakened King Arthur, the gargoyles defeated their
foes. Angela then chose to leave with Goliath and Elisa.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Due to the magical nature of Avalon, Angela was not at first sent to New
York, but to various places around the world where she was needed. During
these adventures, she was confronted with many revelations, among them the
fact that Goliath was her father and, much more shocking, that Demona was
her mother. Eventually, she did come to New York where she met the rest of
the gargoyles, who as it turned out had not seen a female gargoyle in over
a thousand years.
