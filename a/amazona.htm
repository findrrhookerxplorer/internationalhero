race that perished during the last ice age. Only the hardiest now survive
the rigours of their new home, living in the frozen north away from the rest
of mankind. When their citadel was accidentally discovered by Blake Manners,
sole survivor of a ill-fated expedition, they gave him shelter, and Amazona,
who had become enamoured of Manners, accompanied him when he returned home.

Amazona only made a single appearance, but she predates that other Amazon,
Wonder Woman, by more than a year.
