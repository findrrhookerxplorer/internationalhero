Albrecht Strong is the son of the "science hero"
<A HREF="../t/tomstrong.htm">Tom Strong</A>, although for many years his
father was unaware of his existence. His mother is a Nazi superwoman,
<A HREF="../i/ingweiss.htm">Ingrid Weiss</A>, who captured Tom during the
last days of World War II. While Tom was unconscious, a sample of his seed
was extracted without his knowledge, and later used to impregnate Ingrid.
Her son from this process, Albrecht, had his father's superhuman strength
and durability, but was brought up with his mother's Aryan ideals.
