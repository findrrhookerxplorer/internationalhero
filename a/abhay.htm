<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Abhay uses state of the art equipment. Agniputra's
powers are unknown.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Abhay is a heroic crimefighter who uses high tech equipment
in his battles. But when gadgetry fails his "divine other self" takes over.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
ABHAY is a dare-devil hero, while AGNIPUTRA is like a guiding angel to him.
And what a superb combination they make. ABHAY fights crime with the help
of the state-of-the art technology. But as you know, sometimes gimmicks fail
and then AGNIPUTRA-his other divine self-comes to his rescue. Faced with
equally resourceful enemies, the duo have to perform their best, always.
The result is a never-ending series of nail-biting encounters, which thrill
and humour you simultaneously.

<B>Comments</B>: I'm not sure what exactly is the relationship between these
two - whether they count as separate entities (connected say like Captain
Marvel and Rick Jones), or whether Agniputra and Abhay are two aspects of
one man (like Bruce Banner and the Hulk).
