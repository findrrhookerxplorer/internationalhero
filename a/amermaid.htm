<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: American Maid is incredibly athletic, able to jump
around rooftops with ease. She is able to throw a mean shoe. She can kick
these heels off with sufficient skill to disarm enemies or pin them to walls
through their clothes, and like another patriotic hero's shield, the shoes
will return to her like boomerangs.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Probably the most effective superhero in The City is the
patriotic domestic, American Maid...which says a lot about the calibre of
heroes protecting the place. One of <A HREF="../t/tick.htm">The Tick's</A>
closest allies, she bounds across rooftops in her stiletto heels, using both
them and her tiara as projectiles when battle calls. When vehicular transport
is needed, she employs her catering truck. She and
<A HREF="../f/fleder.htm">Die Fledermaus</A>, another of The City's heroes,
have a long running love/hate relationship going on.

    ALIGN="Left">Comments</B>: Voiced by Kay Lenz. In the live action TV series
the character "Captain Liberty" turned up, played by Liz Vassey and clearly
inspired by American Maid. I'm not sure why they didn't use American Maid
instead, but perhaps there were copyright fears over similarities to another
company's character.
