<IMG SRC="angelac2.jpg" WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="320" ALIGN="Left"><B>First
Appearance</B>: Angel Ace (Alamat Comics)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Able to fly, apparently by generating an anti-gravity
field. She can also affect the mass and gravity of other objects, although
at the moment she needs to touch them to do so. Slightly stronger than most
people, with superhuman reflexes, speed, endurance and toughness. Although
she isn't bulletproof, she can shrug off blows that would knock most people
out, and she heals rapidly.&nbsp;Angel has photographic reflexes, allowing
her to swiftly learn new skills simply by seeing them demonstrated once.
Her father &nbsp;also trained her in a variety of martial arts including
karate, kung fu, savate, muay thai, capeoria, ninjitsu, jujitsu and some
secret special forces military styles. In combat things appear to slow down
to Angel, until the rest of the world seems to be moving in freeze-frame.

<B>History</B>: Angel was an orphan adopted as a child by former spy and
mercenary Gregor, aka the Wolf, who found her a prisoner in the Temple of
Clouds in the Himalayas. She grew up into a beautiful young woman, although
her father's enemies made the notion of settling down in one place virtually
impossible. Once she reached adulthood she somehow gained the ability to
fly. This power drew unwanted attention from many who thought to exploit
the young woman, forcing her to become a fugitive.
