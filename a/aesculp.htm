<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Aesculpian can empathise with and control organic
matter at a range of several metres. She can use this to animate organic
material to follow her commands, and to stimulate growth or healing.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: Aesculpian &nbsp;is a member of the Potentate, one of the
world's most powerful super teams, and certainly the most radically active.
They respect no political boundaries and go where they feel they are most
needed, regardless of what an authority group thinks of it. Although Aesculpian
can use her powers offensively, she is more commonly used for intelligence
gathering (her powers can pinpoint people and their exact positions from
a distance and without seeing them), and healing after the fight ends.
