<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Like all members of the Morituri, Adept's strength
and endurance are superhuman. Her specific Morituri power was that of analysis
- she could naturally study and comprehend virtually anything, including
complex alien technology, given a little time.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History</B>: A deeply spiritual and committed Christian, Jelene
Anderson&nbsp;volunteered for the Morituri process out of a sense of
responsibility after discovering she was genetically compatible for the process.
In spite of her hatred of violence, she felt that if she could help defend
humanity against the Horde, the sacrifice was worth it. She eventually died
when returning with the team from a space trip to the vicinity of Jupiter.
