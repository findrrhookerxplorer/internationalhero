Welcome to the International Catalogue of Superheroes. The purpose of this
site is to build up a database of information about various superhero characters
from around the world. For decades American comics, and especially those
from two prolific publishing houses, have dominated if not the market, then
certainly the public's perception of it. There are few people in the world
who would not recognise Superman, Batman, Spider-Man or the X-Men, and there
are hundreds of websites devoted to those characters. That is not the focus
of this site. One day, perhaps, I will start to index those famous characters,
but that day, if it comes about, is some way off.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Instead this site is intended to cover less well known, but no less worthy,
creations. In particular it aims to showcase some of the international diversity
that exists in the superhero world. There are large sections devoted to heroes
from Britain, France, Canada, Australia, Japan and many other countries,
which continue to expand as I learn more about the heroes of each of those
countries. From the U.S.A. I've tried to give coverage to characters who
appeared in many Independent comics (e.g. non-Marvel or D.C.), as well as
film and television.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
It's an ongoing process and will never be finished, as there will always
be new characters being created, old ones being unearthed, and further
information on existing ones coming to light. The first thing I always do
with any encyclopedia or "Handbook" is look for certain favourite, but obscure,
characters, to see what has been missed out. If you do the same, and find
that I am missing someone you think needs including, or have erroneous
information (bear in mind that a lot of times, especially with older characters,
I am going on second hand information) then please
<A HREF="f/faq.htm#Email">e-mail</A> me. Contributions are always welcome.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
While I've tried to go to the original source material as much as possible,
nonetheless some of my information has, by necessity, been taken from on-line.
Where this is the case I try to contact whatever site I've cribbed from for
permission, and to give credit to the original source - if you see something
here that you think has come from your site, and I haven't contacted or credited
you or you wish me to remove it, please <A HREF="f/faq.htm#Email">e-mail</A>
me so I can fix whatever I've done wrong. &nbsp;I'll state it below in a
proper disclaimer, but for the record I intend this to be a work of reference
so any copyrighted images I'm using are for those purposes only; copyright
still belongs to the original holder; and if that copyright owner or their
representatives want me to take something off the site I will do so upon
request.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank the many contributors who
have helped by sending in pictures or information; many of the national pages
in particular would be much less developed without their assistance. When
the site was younger and smaller, I tried to list them here, but that has
long since become impossible, so now the individual thanks tends to be on
specific pages; that does not make me any less grateful for the help provided.

I started doing this site because of an American comic fan's comment on a
message board that foreign superheroes (at least those done by Marvel and
DC, the "Big Two") tend to be either rip-offs of American characters or
horrendous stereotypes. When you consider characters like DC's Beefeater,
Tasmanian Devil, etc, or Marvel's <A HREF="c/capbrit.htm">Captain Britain</A>
(in the days when Larry Lieber was writing him), then you can see he has
a point. But I felt that this was an unfair slur - Britain certainly has
a long history of home grown heroes that don't fall into either of these
traps, and I knew from collecting titles like
<A HREF="n/nrthgrd.htm">Northguard</A> and <A HREF="s/southsqd.htm">Southern
Squadron</A> that the same was true for Canada and Australia. So I started
putting together this site.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
It's been an illuminating experience so far - I've discovered some of the
diversity of the French superhero scene, learned more about some Japanese
characters I previously only had a passing acquaintance with, found out about
some of the history and the current state of the Antipodean comics industry,
and so on. But a problem has become clear as I've been putting things together.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Nationality isn't so easy to define.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Some cases are very clear - Northguard and <A HREF="c/canuck.htm">Captain
Canuck</A> are both Canadian characters created by Canadian writers and first
published by Canadian companies in Canada. That's easy to handle.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
But what about <A HREF="a/alpha.htm">Johnny Alpha</A>, the Strontium Dog?
British writer, British character, British publisher, but the main defining
artist who handled him is Spanish. Given a writer vs. artist nationality
decision, I'm inclined to decide in favour of the writer, who puts the dialogue
in the character's mouth. I can include him in the British section.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Fine - how about <A HREF="d/dredd.htm">Judge Dredd</A>? British writer, British
publisher... American character. But I don't think anyone can argue that
there is something indefinably British about him (albeit he is a skewed look
at how Brits sometimes see Americans and especially their attitudes towards
the rest of the world). But if I'm going to allow a Brit's version of an
American character, then why is that more valid and less a stereotype than
an American's version of a British character? Perhaps because of our exposure
to a lot more of American popular culture we can create American characters
that are less (unintentionally) laughable caricatures? Maybe. Or maybe it's
just that we should recognise that a <B>good</B> writer can write a good
character regardless of either one's nationality. Chris Claremont (American)
has written good, non-cringeworthy characters from all over the globe; so
has Alan Moore (British), Grant Morrison (British, but also Scottish), John
Byrne (Canadian), etc. A good writer moves beyond the land they come from
to be a true everyman (or woman).
<P ALIGN=Justify>
What I'm trying to say is that in some respects the entries I've included
in each section can sometimes seem somewhat arbitrary. Going strictly by
my mandate I should either drop characters like Dredd, or I should include
every character ever written by a British or French or Canadian or ... writer.
What it comes down to in the end is that I've included who I feel should
be included, and left the others out. If you feel I've missed someone important,
please let me know.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
And speaking as a Scot living in England, I'm not even going to start on
whether Scottish characters created by English writers are valid. Lastly,
if I've included someone in the UK section and the writer is actually from
Eire (the Republic of&nbsp;Ireland for those who don't know), sorry - please
correct me.
