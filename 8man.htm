<B>Powers/Abilities</B>: Able to run as fast as a train, superhumanly strong
and durable. Able to shape-shift to look like any human. If he overexerted
himself, and began to run low on energy, he had energy capsules disguised
to look like cigarettes, which he would light as if they were cigarettes,
and then draw on them to recharge himself.

<B>History</B>: After Detective Yokota was killed in the line of duty, his
consciousness was electronically transferred into a robot body designed by
Dr.Tani. He took on the new identity as a private detective, Hachiro Azuma,
but continued to fight crime as the costumed hero 8-Man.

Years later Yokota disappeared. However 8 Man lived on when another cop killed
in the line of duty was resurrected, to battle new, cyborg, criminals. Hazama
Itsuru was a more violent cop in life, and thus a more violent 8 Man than
his predecessor.
