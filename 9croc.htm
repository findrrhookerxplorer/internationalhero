<B>History</B>: Nine Crocodile is from another timestream that is slowly
collapsing. By unravelling our timestream he hopes to save his own. He and
his Ebonati have set up a base in the liquid core of 5-Worlds, a world
representative of all time in our own. From there he sends agents to create
paradox, playing hell with our time. Caza discovered his plot in the 23rd
century, and managed to escape with his prototype time machine before his
lab was destroyed, and now travels time preventing or undoing Krok's work.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Comments</B>: Krok cannot breathe for long without his mask because of
an injury Caza gave him in the past.
