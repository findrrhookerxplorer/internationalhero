In more than 30 years of publication, <A HREF="2000ad.htm">2000 A.D.</A>
has racked up a lot of stories, and in so doing created a multitude of fictional
alternate realities. There's little point me trying to list all of them here,
not because there's a lot, but because it'd be redundant - I already list
them on the 2000 A.D. page (click on the link in the line above. Instead,
what this page is going to concern itself with is chronicling the cases where
multiple stories share a single reality, or where stories interact with other
realities.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
In other words, don't look below for the
<A HREF="p/projectoverkill.htm">Project Overkill</A> version of Earth. That
story hasn't crossed over with anyone else, so the entry for the story works
fine as an entry for the reality, listing first appearance, history and
significant inhabitants.

      2100: When the deadly 2T(FRU)T virus breaks out in Mega-City Two, Dredd leads
      an expedition across the Cursed Earth to deliver the antidote. In his absence
      the ambitious and insane Deputy Chief Judge Cal, head of the SJS, begins
      a grab for power by using the Judge's briefing machines, which plant information
      direct into their brains, to brainwash most of the Judge's to be unswervingly
      loyal to him.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      2101: Dredd returns home to a hero's welcome, but Cal frames him for murder.
      Even though Dredd manages to prove his innocence, Cal continues his planned
      grab for power, having Chief Judge Goodman assassinated and appointing himself
      Chief Judge. Dredd leads a resistance movement of Judges who accidentally
      evaded the brainwashing, including Academy of Law tutors.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      2102: Cal is finally slain by Dredd's ally Fergie on the 100th day of his
      reign, just before carrying out a sentence of death on the entire city. The
      undead Judge Death comes <A HREF="index.htm#Deadworld">from his own reality</A> to
      visit his lethal brand of justice on Dredd's city, but is captured within
      the mind of telepath Cassandra Anderson. Soon after this, Psi-Judge Feyy
      makes a dying prediction that Mega-City One will be doomed in 2120 unless
      Owen Krysler, the psychic mutant known as the Judge Child, can be found to
      lead the city. Dredd leads a mission to find Krysler, even heading into space
      when the Angel Gang kidnap the boy, but when he finally catches up with the
      boy, Dredd judges him to be evil, and rejects Feyy's prediction as flawed.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      2103: Death is freed by his colleagues, but Dredd and Anderson pursue the
      Dark Judges to Deadworld and seemingly destroy them. Later in the year East-Meg
      One sends an undercover judge, Orlok, into Mega-City One, to poison the water
      supply with a rage-inducing supplement, triggering city wide Block Wars.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      2104: Orlok is finally caught by Dredd, but his arrest triggers the next
      phase of East-Meg's plan. Supreme Judge Bulgarin starts the Apocalypse War,
      launching a devastating nuclear attack on Mega-City One, whose defenses are
      in chaos; East-Meg One is protected from the retaliatory strike by Apocalypse
      Shields, which transport Mega-City's missiles to <A HREF="index.htm#Destroyed">another
      reality</A>. Dredd eventually leads a covert mission to commandeer an East-Meg
      missile bunker, and uses the Sov-Block city's own weapons to reduce East-Meg
      One to a smoking crater, ending the war. Mega-City One begins the slow process
      of rebuilding.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      2106: With the development of the Proteus time capsule, Dredd and Anderson
      go on a mission to 2120 to check out the validity of Feyy's prediction. They
      find a <A HREF="index.htm#City">city of horrors</A> ruled by the Mutant, a mutated
      clone of the Judge Child, and barely make it back home. To prevent this timeline
      coming to pass, the forewarned Judges destroy the Mutant in its infancy.

      McGruder return from the Cursed Earth and free the city from the reign of
      terror, though Death remains on the loose.

      2113: Judge Death escapes via Dimension Jump technology to Gotham City on
      Earth-1 (Post-Crisis &amp; Zero Hour version, DC Universe), and the vigilante
      Batman in turn ends up in MC1, where Mean Machine Angel promptly steals the
      D-Jump technology to follow Death. After Judge Dredd arrests Batman, Judge
      Anderson helps him escape and with Dredd in tow they travel to Gotham City

      <B>Conflicts: </B>With strips that were not initially planned to share a
      universe, it's unsurprising that some dating conflicts have arisen.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      The official 2000 A.D. site places the ABC Warriors strip and the end of
      the Volg War as happening in 2023. Immediately after the war's end, Hammerstein's
      unit is sent to tame Mars, where among other opponents, they face Golgotha,
      the offspring of the Satanus clone. Unfortunately Judge Dredd's strip states
      that Satanus didn't get cloned until at least 2040. Either the cloning has
      to take place earlier, or we've got to assume that there's more than one
      Volg War, and it is the second one which ends later. This actually makes
      more sense, as it is unlikely that if the entire world had been at war for
      more than 20 years (1999 to 2023) that Martian colonies would have been set
      up during that conflict; the resources for space exploration on that scale
      would have gone into the war effort. If there are two conflicts, Hammerstein
      seems to have fought in both - in the Ro-Busters flashback story to his origin,
      one of his allies hopes to help build the new Mega-Cities, and at the end
      of that flashback he is put in charge of robots identical to himself; a platoon
      of similar robots turn up in Savage, set circa 2008; the ABC Warriors strip
      by contrast shows a more technologically advanced world with a plethora of
      different robot designs. It's probably not unreasonable to assume that the
      introduction of Hammerstein-style war robots helped drive the Volgs back
      and end the first Volg conflict, but that a few decades later the Volgs tried
      again, now equipped with their own robot designs. &nbsp;
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Tying in with the Volg conflict indirectly is Ro-Busters. It's set in 2080,
      again after the Atomic Wars, but in a world that doesn't seem to fit that
      description. However, it is mostly set in Britain, so presumably the damage
      there was less severe, at least until after the second British Civil War
      of the 2090s. Howard Quartz apparently turns up in Bill Savage's era (circa
      2008) and also in Ro-Busters. However, by the latter he has mostly replaced
      his human body with robotic parts, and when we meet his brother Ebeneezer
      we see that Howard's still human sibling is ancient.

      <B>Comments:</B> When two strips are connected by guest appearances from
      characters from other strips, where time or dimension travel wasn't used
      to get between strips, then they are considered linked (unless other factors
      come into play - see Savage note below). Shared events are considered less
      strong links - e.g. the Volg War appears in multiple stories in 2000 A.D.
      and is a link, but two different realities may have both experienced the
      Second World War, so shared events in themselves are not absolute confirmation.
      As noted on the map page, shared species are not considered evidence of a
      shared timeline - after all, the human race appears in most stories, and
      Predators have menaced both Batman and Judge Dredd, who explicitly don't
      share the same timeline. Using the above guidelines, the following stories
      are established as part of this timeline:
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Flesh (Cretaceous era/first storyline) - ties to Judge Dredd because Satanus,
	  who dies in Flesh is resurrected via cloning in Judge Dredd.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Disaster 1990 - shares lead character with Invasion, explicitly written as
	  a prequel to Invasion.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Invasion - shares lead character with Savage, whose opponents, the Volgs,
	  are also the same foes fighting the same war in ABC Warriors.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  ABC Warriors (early stories) - Introduced as a spin-off prequel to Ro-Busters,
	  and initially told as a flashback to that story. Hammerstein is fighting
	  the war that began in Invasion, and when his team goes to Mars they encounter
	  Golgotha, the offspring of the cloned Satanus, their first tie to Judge Dredd
	  (and indirectly Flesh). Hammerstein's later involvement in the new US Civil
	  War is depicted in Judge Dredd. Immune to aging because of their robot nature,
	  the Warriors survive on into Nemesis' much later era.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Harlem Heroes (original series) - John "Giant" Clay appears as an older man
	  in Judge Dredd.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Inferno - direct sequel to Harlem Heroes.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Ro-Busters - features Hammerstein and (briefly) Joe Pineapples, both members
	  of the ABC Warriors.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Judge Dredd - Dredd encountered the cloned Satanus, tying him to Flesh. He
	  has met Hammerstein, tying him to ABC Warriors, and John "Giant" Clay, whose
	  son and grandson became judges, tying him to Harlem Heroes.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Umpteen stories are spin-offs of Dredd and set in his era. I'm not going
	  to list them all here, but you can find them on the main 2000 A.D. page.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Red Razors is set fifty years after Judge Dredd, but explicitly in the same
	  world, and a Dredd clone turns up.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Harlem Heroes (second series) - the penal colony criminals named themselves
	  after the original Harlem Heroes squad.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Nemesis encounters the ABC Warriors, tying him back to them. His strip also
	  has Satanus in it, and a Mega-City Judge turns up in one issue, but both
	  are brought to Nemesis' era by time travel, so they don't count for proving
	  a shared timeline.
      </UL>
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Realities presumed to be part of the timeline. These are via time travel
      connections - in other fictions, time travel can mean travelling sideways
      to a parallel timeline at the same time as going back or forward in time.
      However, authorial intent in 2000 A.D. generally seems to be that time travel
      stays within a single timeline. The definite exception to this has to be
      the later ABC Warriors stories, set after they travel back from the far future
      to late 21st century, because details of the timeline they end up in clash
      with the timelines of other stories.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Flesh (Book 2 on, plus the native 23rd century era of the dinosaur hunters)
	  - time travel links these to the Cretaceous era Flesh, meaning in theory
	  that sideways travel to other timelines might be occurring. However, based
	  on authorial intent, it's meant to be the same timeline, so I've included
	  it in the history above.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Strontium Dog (and same era spin-offs Strontium Dog, Tales from the Doghouse,
	  etc) - time travel links Johnny Alpha and Judge Dredd, and though Alpha knows
	  Dredd's time as his past, the possibility exists that Alpha is only one possible
	  future for Dredd. However, again authorial intent is for them to be sharing
	  a timeline, so Strontium Dog is factored into the history above. That said,
	  more recent Strontium Dog stories have apparently hinted that earlier stories
	  are merely fictional accounts of his adventures; whether this will result
	  in a second Strontium Dog timeline is uncertain at this point.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Durham Red's solo stories apparently cast doubt on her past adventures in
	  Strontium Dog. Again, whether this makes her solo adventures a millennia
	  after the Strontium Dog stories a separate timeline, I don't yet know. For
	  the moment though, I've included her era as part of the history.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Rogue Trooper - Friday and other GI's time travel to Mega-City One in 2000
	  A.D. Prog 900. There is a prototype GI in Judge Dredd Megazine, but since
	  Friday's owners traded technology for the right to use Mega-City One as a
	  safe harbour, the Judges may have obtained the tech needed to create the
	  GI that way.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Skizz - the Gun Lords of Omega Ceti who appear in Skizz encounter a Mega-City
	  One Judge after time travelling.
      </UL>
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Realities that at first glance might be assumed to be part of the timeline,
      but which further inspection suggest are separate timelines.
      <UL>
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Robo-Hunter - Sam Slade spent a significant period adventuring in Brit Cit,
	  which is also the name of a city in Judge Dredd. However, it's difficult
	  to reconcile his timeline with the main one. He initially adventures in an
	  unspecified US city that clearly does not have Mega-City style judges and
	  laws (or Sam would be locked up), placing him either before the inception
	  of the Judges (2031) or after they fell (an unspecified point after Judge
	  Dredd's current date, late 2120s). Earlier than 2031 is problematic, since
	  Slade had a 30 plus year career prior to the start of his own series, and
	  sophisticated robots weren't widespread around the end of the 20th century.
	  On the other hand, Brit Cit is destroyed no later than the British atomic
	  war of 2150 and long gone by the era of Johnny Alpha (circa 2180s). It's
	  possible it eventually gets rebuilt though, and Slade lives in a later era,
	  but then the supposed link, Brit Cit, isn't a real link anyway because it's
	  still not the same city. So, for the moment, I'm treating Robo-Hunter as
	  another timeline, one which happens to have its own version of Brit Cit.
	<LI>
	  <P ALIGN=Justify>
	  Savage shares the lead character with Disaster 1990 and Invasion, but ABC
	  Warriors turn up in Book 5, and one of Savage's assassinations is referred
	  back to in ABC Warriors' second timeline. This means that while we might
	  assume events in Savage happen in the main 2000 A.D. timeline, it might be
	  the case that instead the main timeline's Bill Savage only experiences events
	  up until the end of Invasion, and the Volg War becomes one of robots shortly
	  thereafter (ABC Warriors's original timeline), while that the Volg War
	  subsequently goes on differently and drags on much longer in Savage's timeline,
	  leading into ABC Warriors' 2nd timeline.

      (IPC, 24th November 1984)
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      <B>History:</B> In 2110 the Mutant, a mutated clone of psychic Owen Krysler,
      manifested above Mega-City One and took over the city in the space of minutes.
      It slew Judge Dredd, and turned the other judges into vampires, to literally
      feed off the citizens as they had figuratively done up till this time (in
      the Mutant's opinion). Having concluded his revenge on Dredd had been over
      too quickly, the Mutant subsequently revived him as a zombie. In 2120, Judges
      Dredd and Anderson travelled forward in time from 2107, investigating the
      prophecy that had inadvertently triggered this timeline. Soon realising they
      could not defeat the Mutant here at the height of its power, they travelled
      back to their own era, where Dredd slew the monster moments after it was
      decanted. Thus Dredd's timeline diverged from this one, although the Mutant's
      timeline presumably still exists.

      <B>History:</B> After Chief Judge Cal defeated Judge Dredd's insurrection,
      he went on to rule Mega-City One for more than two decades. Eventually he
      got hold of dimension jump technology from Deadworld's Dark Judges, which
      he used to spread his influence across numerous realities, risking a multiversal
      collapse. He targeted the Dredd of the main 2000 A.D. timeline, gathering
      various old foes of the lawman; in their timelines they had slain Dredd,
      but in the main 2000 A.D. their counterparts had been beaten by Dredd.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      In an alternative dimension, Judge Cal (see The Day the Law Died) was not
      defeated by Dredd, and has obtained dimension jump technology from the Dark
      Judges. He uses this to cause chaos between the dimensions, bringing back
      many of Dredd's greatest foes from other alternative dimensions, as well
      as a variety of characters from other 2000 AD stories (including cameos from
      D.R. and Quinch and others). On the verge of the total collapse of all universes
      (Helter Skelter), Dredd defeats Cal with the help of dimension technician
      Darien Kenzie.

      <B>History:</B> In the future man is but one of several species living among
      the stars. Hauling cargo between the worlds are the space truckers, including
      the irrepressible Ace Garp.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      Ace later visited a reality parallel to his own, and later briefly ended
      up in Mega-City 1.
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      <B>Comments:</B> It's not impossible that this is the main 2000 A.D. reality
      at an unspecified point in the future, especially as this reality has Kleggs
      in it, an alien species that also turned up in Judge Dredd.</TD>

      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      <B>History:</B> After being tricked into believing he had a terminal illness,
      Ace Garp flew into a sun to die, but instead found himself in a parallel
      universe where he was rescued by his own counterpart. With no immediate way
      of returning home, the newcomer was forced to find a way to get along with
      his "doppelgarp."
      <P ALIGN=Justify>
      <B>Comments:</B> In the picture, the Ace from the original Ace Trucking universe
      is the one on the right, with the tip of his point sliced off. Apart from
      that, there seems to be no discernible major difference between the two
      timelines.

      The original Ace finally found his way home in 2000 A.D. Annual 1989's "The
