<B>History</B>: Daniel Dyce was a kind hearted District Attorney, who bore
an uncanny resemblance to his friend Jacob Horn. Horn was in custody awaiting
trial, but desperately wanted to see his wife give birth, so Dan agreed to
swap places with him temporarily. However Jacob was killed on the way to
the hospital, struck by a car, while Dan, in his place, was convicted and
sentenced to life in Westmoor Prison as prisoner #711. Unable to prove his
true identity, Dan tunnelled his way out, but (bizarrely) chose to return
to his cell instead of his old life, escaping each night to fight crime and
leaving calling cards so his foes would know he was after them. After several
months of living like this, he was killed by mobster Oscar Jones during a
gun battle with the police. The hero <A HREF="d/destiny.htm">Destiny</A>
sensed the crime, and made <I>his </I>crimefighting debut at the scene of
711's demise.
