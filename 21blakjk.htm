<B>History</B>: Tyrone Blade was once one of the most gifted demolitions
experts the United States Marines ever trained. Blade earned a Congressional
Medal of Honor during a mission into the heart of Viet Nam to rescue POW's
who were still being held by the communist government. After his tour of
duty was complete, Blade joined the Orleans Parish Sheriff's department.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Once again, Blade showed his strength and became a lead detective in
Robbery/Homicide. Blade was approached by agents of the FBI to assist them
in an on-going investigation into the activities of an alledged crime boss
known as Master Midnight. Blade went deep undercover and became a trusted
member of Midnight's operations.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
However, Midnight's moles within the Department of Justice informed him of
Blade and of his mission. Midnight became furious and ordered that Blade
be made to suffer. Midnight came up with a plan, thinking that since Blade
wanted to live among criminals so badly, he would arrange it. Midnight personally
slaughtered Blade's entire family and had Blade himself framed for the murders.
Using his influence within the Department of Justice, Midnight had Blade
convicted and sentenced to death by lethal injection.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
Blade sat on death row for ten years, continuing to proclaim his innocence,
but he also became consumed by hatred and revenge. On the day of his execution,
a mysterious government agent named Smythe approached Blade and offered him
a chance for redemption and a chance to get revenge on the man that put him
on death row, Master Midnight.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
He told Blade about the Black Jack Project and how he would become the 21st
agent of the highly specialized task force designed for the sole purpose
of hunting down and eliminating potential and known terrorists. He would
be equipped with the governments most sophisticated weaponry and technology.
If he went on several key missions, they would provide him with the information
on the whereabouts of Master Midnight. Blade accepted the offer. Agent Smythe
arranged the televised 'execution' of rogue officer Tyrone Blade. Ater the
mock execution was over, Smythe took Blade to a secret underground installation
deep in the Louisiana bayou. Blade assumed the name 21 Black Jack, since
he was the twenty-first member of the team, and also because of the 'spade'
tattoo that he got over his left eye while in prison. Once equipped with
a mobile arsenal, 21 Black Jack began his one-man war on Master Midnight
and his operations.
