Created, written and drawn by Yuzo Takada, Sazan Eyes is your everyday story
of indestructible teenage zombies protecting ancient three-eyed beings from
demons of the Shadow World. First appearing in Young Magazine (a weekly title
published by Kodansha), Sazan Eyes (a.k.a. 3 x 3 Eyes) is the story of Pai,
an immortal Sanjiyan, of Fujii Yajumo, the school boy whose soul she took,
turning him into her invulnerable undead protector, and of Pai's quest to
become human. Published in English by <A HREF="i/innovat.htm">Innovation</A>,
and latterly <A HREF="d/darkhors.htm">Dark Horse</A>, the Manga has also
been turned anime by Bandai Visual, who have released several installments
of the series in that format.
