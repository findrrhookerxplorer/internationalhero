<B>Purpose:</B><B> </B>To fight crime.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Affiliations:</B> The Commissioner
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Enemies: </B>Green Terror (said to be African, although he is drawn as
an aged golden-skinned Caucasian, blood-drinker, allegedly immortal).
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Base of Operations: </B>New York
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>First Appearance: </B>Mystic Comics #1 (<A HREF="t/timelycomics.htm">Timely
Comics</A>, March 1940)
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>History: </B>The 3X's were a trio of crime-fighting siblings, each of
whom brought specific abilities to their endeavours - 1X was the detective,
leaning more to Sam Spade than Sherlock Holmes; 2X was the brains, a
knowledgeable bald genius who carried a disintegration gun; and 3X was the
brawn, a hulking brute of a man.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
In their only recorded case, the 3X's investigated a kidnapping which eventually
brought them into conflict with the blood-drinking Green Terror and his gang.
<P ALIGN=Justify>
<B>Comments:</B> The 3X's made their sole appearance in Mystic Comics #1,
and haven't been seen since. They were probably based on a similar group
who starred in the popular U.S. radio show "I Love A Mystery".
